                        <div><p class="text-left">The following evening great expectation took hold of the house.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the carriage at last drove up, the servants flew downstairs( 下楼 ), followed by Miss Rottenmeier in more measured( 谨慎小心的 ) step.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi had been sent to her room to wait for further orders, but it was not long before she was ordered to go to the study.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmama( 祖母 ), with her kind and loving way, immediately became friends with the child and made her feel as if she had known her always.</p>
<p class="text-left">To the housekeeper’s great shame, the grandmama called the child Heidi, remarking( 说话 ) to Miss Rottenmeier:</p>
<p class="text-left">“If somebody’s name is Heidi, I call her so.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The housekeeper( 管家 ) soon found that she had to respect the grandmother’s ways and opinions.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Sesemann always knew what was going on in the house the minute she entered it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara was resting the following afternoon.</p>
<p class="text-left">The old lady had shut her eyes for five minutes, when she got up again and went into the dining room, where Heidi was.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Rottenmeier had told her that Heidi could not read, and she decided to look into the matter.</p>
<p class="text-left">Instead of teaching Heidi to read, the grandmama showed her a large book with beautiful pictures.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly Heidi screamed( 尖叫 ) aloud, for there on the picture she saw a peaceful group of goats( 山羊 ) on a green pasture( 牧场 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">In the middle a goatherd( 牧羊人 ) was standing.</p>
<p class="text-left">The setting sun was shedding( 洒 ) a golden light over everything.</p>
<p class="text-left">With glowing( 热情洋溢的 ) eyes Heidi took in the scene eagerly( 渴望地 ); but suddenly she began to sob( 啜泣 ) violently( 激烈地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmama took her little hand in hers and said in the most comforting voice,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come, child, you must not cry. Did this remind( 使记起 ) you of something?</p>
<p class="text-left">Now stop, dry your tears( 眼泪 ) now, darling( 亲爱的 ), I must ask you something.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi did not stop at once, but the kind lady gave her enough time to calm( 使冷静 ) herself, saying from time to time,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now it’s all over. Now we’ll be merry( 欢乐的 ) again.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When the child was quiet at last, she said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Tell me now how your lessons are going. What have you learnt, child, tell me?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Nothing,” Heidi sighed( 叹息 );</p>
<p class="text-left">“but I knew that I never could learn it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am going to tell you something, Heidi,” said the kind lady.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I expect that you will learn it in a very short time, as a great many other children do.</p>
<p class="text-left">When you can read, I am going to give you this book.</p>
<p class="text-left">You have seen the shepherd( 牧羊人 ) on the green pasture.</p>
<p class="text-left">You’ll be able to find out all the strange things that happen to him.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yes, you can hear the whole story, and what he does with his goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">You would like to know, wouldn’t you, Heidi?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi had listened with great attention, and said with shining eyes,</p>
<p class="text-left">“If only I could read already!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“It won’t be long, I can see that. Come now and let us go to Clara.” With that they both went over to the study.</p>
<p class="text-left">Even though Heidi enjoyed spending time with her new friends, she longed to see the mountains again.</p>
<p class="text-left">Only in her dreams she would be happy.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she woke up in the morning, she always found herself on her high white bed, far away from home.</p>
<p class="text-left">Burying( 埋 ) her head in her pillow( 枕头 ), she would often weep( 哭泣 ) a long, long time.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Sesemann had noticed the child’s unhappiness, but she let a few days pass by, hoping for a change.</p>
<p class="text-left">But the change never came, and often Heidi’s eyes were red even in the early morning.</p>
<p class="text-left">So she called the child to her room one day.</p>
<p class="text-left">With great sympathy( 同情 ) in her voice she said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Tell me, Heidi, what is the matter with you? What is making you so sad?”</p>
<p class="text-left">But as Heidi did not want to appear thankless, she replied sadly:</p>
<p class="text-left">“I can't tell you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No? Can’t you tell Clara perhaps?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, no, I can’t tell anyone,” Heidi said, looking so unhappy that the old lady’s heart was filled with pity.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I tell you something, little girl,” she continued.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If you have a sorrow( 伤心事 ) that you cannot tell anyone, you can go to Our Father in Heaven( 天堂 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Have you ever prayed( 祈祷 ), Heidi? Do you know what I mean?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I only prayed with my first grandmother, but it is so long ago, that I have forgotten.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“See, Heidi, I understand now why you are so unhappy.</p>
<p class="text-left">We all need somebody to help us.</p>
<p class="text-left">We can tell the Lord everything and ask Him to comfort us, when nobody else can do it.</p>
<p class="text-left">He can give us happiness.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Can we tell Him everything, everything?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, Heidi, everything.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The child said hurriedly,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Can I go to pray now?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, of course,” was the reply, and with this Heidi ran to her room.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sitting down on a chair, she folded( 交叠 ) her hands and poured( 倾泻 ) out her heart to God, asking Him to help her and let her go home to her grandfather.</p></div>

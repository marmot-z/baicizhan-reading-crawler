                        <div><p class="text-left">Heidi suddenly wiped away( 擦掉 ) her tears( 眼泪 ), for she had had a cheering thought.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandmother, I shall tell grandfather about it, and I am sure he can make you see the light again. He can mend( 修补 ) your little house and stop the sound.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The old woman remained silent, and Heidi, with the greatest liveliness, began to describe her life with the grandfather.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi’s tale( 讲述 ) was interrupted( 被打断 ) suddenly by a loud knocking on the door; and Peter came in.</p>
<p class="text-left">No sooner had he seen Heidi than he smiled, opening his round eyes as wide as possible.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi called, “Good evening, Peter!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is it really time for him to come home!” said Peter’s grandmother in surprise.</p>
<p class="text-left">“How quickly the time has flown.</p>
<p class="text-left">Good evening, little Peter; how is your reading going?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Just the same,” the boy replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, dear, I was hoping for a change at last.</p>
<p class="text-left">You are nearly twelve years old, my boy.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why should there be a change?” asked Heidi with greatest interest.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am afraid he’ll never learn it after all.</p>
<p class="text-left">On the shelf( 架子 ) over there is an old prayer( 祈祷 ) book with beautiful songs.</p>
<p class="text-left">I longed that Peter should read them to me some day, but he will never be able to!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter’s mother got up from her work now, saying,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I must make a light. The afternoon has passed and now it’s getting dark.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When Heidi heard those words, she said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Good night. I have to go, for it is getting dark.”</p>
<p class="text-left">But the anxious( 忧虑的 ) grandmother called out:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Wait, child, don’t go up alone!</p>
<p class="text-left">Go with her, Peter, and take care that she does not fall.</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t let her get cold, do you hear?</p>
<p class="text-left">Does Heidi have a scarf?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t, but I won’t be cold,” Heidi called back, for she had already run through the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">She ran so fast that Peter could hardly follow her.</p>
<p class="text-left">The old woman worriedly called out:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Brigida, run after her. Get a warm scarf, she’ll freeze( 结冰 ) in this cold night. Hurry up!” Brigida obeyed( 服从 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The children had hardly climbed any distance, when they saw the old man coming and with a few strong steps he stood beside them.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am glad you kept your word, Heidi,” he said.</p>
<p class="text-left">Packing( 裹 ) her into her cover, he started up the hill, carrying the child in his arms.</p>
<p class="text-left">Brigida had come in time to see it, and told the grandmother what she had witnessed( 看见 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Thank God!” the old woman said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I hope she’ll come again; she has done me so much good!</p>
<p class="text-left">What a soft heart she has, the darling( 亲爱的 ), and how nicely she can talk.”</p>
<p class="text-left">All evening the grandmother said to herself,</p>
<p class="text-left">“If only he lets her come again!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi could hardly wait before they reached the cottage( 乡间小屋 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">As soon as they were inside the hut she began:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandfather, we must take some nails( 钉子 ) and a hammer( 锤子 ) down tomorrow;</p>
<p class="text-left">a shutter( 百叶窗 ) is not fastened( 牢固 ) in grandmother’s house and many other places shake.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is that so? Who says we must?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Nobody told me, but I know,” Heidi replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Nothing in the house is fixed, and poor grandmother told me she was afraid that the house might fall down.</p>
<p class="text-left">And grandfather, she cannot see the light.</p>
<p class="text-left">Can you help her and make her see the light again? ”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi had been holding on to her grandfather and looking up to him with trusting eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">At last he said, glancing down( 向下扫视 ):</p>
<p class="text-left">“All right, child, we’ll see that it won’t make any sounds.</p>
<p class="text-left">We can do it tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was so happy at these words that she danced around the room shouting:</p>
<p class="text-left">“We’ll do it tomorrow! We can do it tomorrow!”</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather, keeping his word, took Heidi down the following day with the same instructions as before.</p>
<p class="text-left">After Heidi had disappeared, he went around the house examining it.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmother called:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Here is the child again!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi, grasping( 抓住 ) her hands, sat herself on a low chair at the old woman’s feet and began to chat( 聊天 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly violent( 猛烈的 ) blows( 爆裂 ) were heard outside;</p>
<p class="text-left">the grandmother in her fright( 恐惧 ) nearly upset( 弄翻 ) the spinning-wheel( 纺车 ) and screamed( 尖叫 ):</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, God! The hut is falling down!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandmother, don’t be frightened( 感到害怕的 ),” said the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandfather is just fixing everything for you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is it possible? Has God not forgotten us after all?</p>
<p class="text-left">Brigida, have you heard it? Surely that is a hammer.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ask him to come in a moment, for I must thank him.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When Brigida went out, she found the old man busy with putting a new beam( 横梁 ) along the wall.</p>
<p class="text-left">Approaching him, she said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Mother and I wish you a good afternoon.</p>
<p class="text-left">We are very thankful to you, and mother would like to see you.</p>
<p class="text-left">Uncle, how can we thank you?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“That will do,” he interrupted.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I know what your opinion about me is. Go in, for I can find what needs fixing myself.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Brigida obeyed.</p>
<p class="text-left">All afternoon the uncle hammered around; he even climbed up on the roof( 屋顶 ), where much was missing.</p>
<p class="text-left">At last he had to stop, for the last nail was gone from his pocket.</p>
<p class="text-left">The darkness had come, and Heidi was ready to go up with him, packed warmly in his arms.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thus the winter passed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sunshine had come again into the blind woman’s life, and made her days less dark and sad.</p>
<p class="text-left">Early every morning she would begin to listen for Heidi’s footsteps.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the door was opened and the child ran in, the grandmother exclaimed( 呼喊 ) joyfully( 高兴地 ):</p>
<p class="text-left">“Thank God, she has come again!”</p></div>

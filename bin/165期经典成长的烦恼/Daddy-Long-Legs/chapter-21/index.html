<p class="text-left">I started this letter ages ago, but I haven’t had a second to finish it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Isn’t this a nice thought from Stevenson?</p>
<p class="text-left">The world is so full of a number of things,</p>
<p class="text-left">I am sure we should all be as happy as kings.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s true, you know.</p>
<p class="text-left">The world is full of happiness, and plenty to go around, if you are only willing to take the kind that comes your way.</p>
<p class="text-left">The whole secret is in being flexible( 灵活的 ). In the country, especially, there are such a lot of interesting things to do.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can walk over everybody’s land, and look at everybody’s view.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can wet my feet in any river, and enjoy it just as much as though I owned the land—with no taxes to pay!</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s Sunday night now, about eleven o’clock. I am supposed to be getting some beauty sleep, but I had black coffee for dinner, so—no beauty sleep for me!</p>
<p class="text-left">This morning, Mrs. Semple said to Mr. Pendleton:</p>
<p class="text-left">“We have to leave here at a quarter past ten in order to get to church by eleven.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Very well, Lizzie,” said Master( 老爷 ) Jervie, “you have the carriage ready, and if I’m not dressed, just go on without waiting.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“We’ll wait,” said she.</p>
<p class="text-left">“As you please,” said he, “only don’t keep the horses standing too long.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then while she was dressing, he told Carrie to pack up( 打包 ) a lunch.</p>
<p class="text-left">He told me to change into my walking clothes.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then we went out through the back door and went fishing.</p>
<p class="text-left">And poor Mrs. Semple believes that people who go fishing on Sundays go to hell!</p>
<p class="text-left">She feels very guilty( 愧疚的 ) that she didn’t train him better when he was small and helpless, and she had the chance.</p>
<p class="text-left">Besides—she wished to show him off in church.</p>
<p class="text-left">Anyway, we had our fishing.</p>
<p class="text-left">He caught four little ones, and we cooked them on a campfire( 篝火 ) for lunch.</p>
<p class="text-left">They kept falling off our sticks into the fire, so they tasted a little of ash( 灰 ), but we ate them.</p>
<p class="text-left">We got home at four, went driving at five, and had dinner at seven.</p>
<p class="text-left">At ten I was sent to bed and here I am, writing to you.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am getting a little sleepy, though.</p>
<p class="text-left">Good night.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ship Ahoy, Captain( 队长 ) Long-Legs!</p>
<p class="text-left">Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum!</p>
<p class="text-left">Guess what I’m reading?</p>
<p class="text-left">Our conversation these past two days has been all about the sea and pirates( 海盗 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Isn’t Treasure Island fun?</p>
<p class="text-left">Did you ever read it, or wasn’t it written when you were a boy?</p>
<p class="text-left">Stevenson only got thirty pounds for the serial rights—I don’t believe it pays to be a great author.</p>
<p class="text-left">Maybe I’ll be a school teacher.</p>
<p class="text-left">Excuse me for filling my letters so full of Stevenson; I’m thinking about him a lot.</p>
<p class="text-left">He is the only author in Lock Willow’s library.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve been writing this letter for two weeks, and I think it’s about long enough.</p>
<p class="text-left">Never say, Daddy, that I don’t give details( 细节 ). I wish you were here, too; we’d all have such a great time together.</p>
<p class="text-left">I like my different friends to know each other.</p>
<p class="text-left">I wanted to ask Mr. Pendleton if he knew you in New York( 纽约，地名 )—I should think he might.</p>
<p class="text-left">You must move in about the same grand social circles, and you are both interested in reforms( 改革 ) and things.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I couldn’t, because I don’t know your real name.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s the silliest thing I ever heard of, not to know your name.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Lippett warned me that you were a little strange.</p>
<p class="text-left">I should think so!</p>
<p class="text-left">Love,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">September 10th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy,</p>
<p class="text-left">He has gone, and we are missing him!</p>
<p class="text-left">When you get used to people or places or ways of living, and then have them taken away, it does leave an awfully empty feeling.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m finding Mrs. Semple’s conversation very plain( 平淡的 ) food.</p>
<p class="text-left">College opens in two weeks, and I shall be glad to begin work again.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have worked quite a lot this summer though—six short stories and seven poems.</p>
<p class="text-left">Those I sent to the magazines all came back almost at once.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I don’t mind. It’s good practice.</p>
<p class="text-left">Master Jervie read them—he brought in the mail( 信件 ), so I couldn’t stop him knowing—and he said they were dreadful( 可怕的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">They showed that I didn’t have the slightest idea what I was talking about. (Master Jervie doesn’t let politeness interfere( 干涉 ) with truth.)</p>
<p class="text-left">But he said the last one I did—just a little story set in college—wasn’t bad.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had it typed, and I sent it to a magazine.</p>
<p class="text-left">They’ve had it two weeks; maybe they’re thinking it over.</p>
<p class="text-left">You should see the sky!</p>
<p class="text-left">There’s the strangest orange-colored light over everything.</p>
<p class="text-left">We’re going to have a storm.</p>
<p class="text-left">And just as I wrote that, it started!</p>
<p class="text-left">I had to run to close the windows.</p>
<p class="text-left">Carrie ran up to the attic( 阁楼 ) with buckets( 桶 ), to put under the places where the roof( 屋顶 ) leaks( 渗漏 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Then, just as I was picking up my pen again, I remembered that I’d left a cushion( 靠垫 ) and my hat and Matthew Arnold’s poems under a tree.</p>
<p class="text-left">So I ran out to get them; they were all very wet.</p>
<p class="text-left">The red cover of the poems had run into the inside.</p>
<p class="text-left">Dover Beach in the future will be washed by pink waves( 波浪 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">A storm is awfully disturbing( 扰乱 ) in the country.</p>
<p class="text-left">You are always having to think of so many things that are out of doors and getting spoiled( 被毁坏 ).</p></div>

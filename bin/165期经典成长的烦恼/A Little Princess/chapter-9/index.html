                        <div><p class="text-left">She had been at Miss Minchin’s school about two years.</p>
<p class="text-left">On one foggy winter’s afternoon, Sara was sitting in the middle of a group in the classroom telling one of her stories.</p>
<p class="text-left">A little servant girl quietly entered the room, carrying a coal box much too heavy for her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She knelt( 跪下 ) down upon the carpet to fix the fire and sweep up the ashes.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was afraid to look at the children or seem to be listening.</p>
<p class="text-left">But Sara saw in two minutes that she was deeply interested in what was going on.</p>
<p class="text-left">The girl was doing her work slowly in the hope of catching a word here and there.</p>
<p class="text-left">Realizing this, Sara raised her voice and spoke more clearly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The Mermaids( 美人鱼 ) swam softly about in the clear green water, and dragged after them a fishing net made of deep-sea pearls( 珍珠 ),” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The Princess sat on the white rock and watched them.”</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a wonderful story about a princess who was loved by a Prince Merman( 人鱼王子 ), and lived with him in shining caves under the sea.</p>
<p class="text-left">The small servant swept the fireplace once and then swept it again.</p>
<p class="text-left">Having done it twice, she did it three times.</p>
<p class="text-left">As she was doing it the third time, the sound of the story so moved her to listen that she fell under the spell.</p>
<p class="text-left">She sat down upon her heels as she knelt on the carpet, and the brush hung unused in her fingers.</p>
<p class="text-left">The voice of the storyteller( 讲故事的人 ) drew her into the story.</p>
<p class="text-left">The brush fell from the girl’s rough hand, and Lavinia Herbert looked round.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That girl has been listening,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">The servant quickly picked up her brush, and jumped to her feet.</p>
<p class="text-left">She caught at the coal box and simply ran out of the room like a frightened rabbit.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara felt rather angry at Lavinia.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I knew she was listening,” she said. “Why shouldn’t she?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Lavinia shook her head with great elegance( 高雅 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Well,” she answered, “I do not know whether your mamma would like you to tell stories to servant girls.</p>
<p class="text-left">I know my mamma wouldn’t like me to do it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“My mamma!” said Sara, looking confused( 困惑的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t believe she would mind in the least. She knows that stories belong to everybody.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I thought,” answered Lavinia unkindly, “that your mamma was dead. How can she know things?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you think she doesn’t know things?” said Sara, in her serious little voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">Without waiting for a response, Sara marched out of the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">She hoped that she might see the servant again, but she did not see her when she got into the hall.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Who is that little girl who makes the fires?” she asked Mariette that night.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mariette answered that she was a sad little thing who had just taken the place of scullery( 洗碗的 ) maid, but she was everything else besides.</p>
<p class="text-left">She cleaned boots and fireplaces, and carried heavy coal boxes up and down stairs.</p>
<p class="text-left">She cleaned floors and windows, and was ordered about by everybody.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was fourteen years old, but was so small in size that she looked about twelve.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What is her name?” asked Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her name was Becky.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mariette heard everyone below stairs calling, “Becky, do this,” and “Becky, do that,” every five minutes in the day.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara sat and looked into the fire, thinking on Becky for some time after Mariette left her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She thought the servant girl looked as if she had never had quite enough to eat.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her very eyes were hungry.</p>
<p class="text-left">She hoped she should see her again.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sadly, Becky always seemed in such a hurry and so afraid of being seen that it was impossible to speak to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">A few weeks later, on another foggy afternoon, when Sara entered her sitting room she found herself looking at a rather sad picture.</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky was sitting in Sara’s own special easy chair before the bright fire.</p>
<p class="text-left">There was a coal mark on her nose and several on her clothing, with her little cap hanging half off her head, and an empty coal box on the floor near her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was fast asleep, tired out beyond the strength of her hard-working young body.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had been sent up to put the bedrooms in order for the evening.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had really been only about ten minutes in the room when Sara entered, but she was in a very deep sleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh!” cried Sara, softly, when she saw her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That poor thing!”</p>
<p class="text-left">She wondered what it would be best to do.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Amelia might come in at any moment, and if she did, Becky would be sure to be punished.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But she is so tired,” she thought.</p>
<p class="text-left">A piece of coal from the fire broke off from a large piece and fell on to the bottom of the fireplace.</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky started, and opened her eyes with a frightened breath.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not know she had fallen asleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had only sat down for one moment and felt the beautiful warmth.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now here she found herself looking in fear at the pupil, who sat quite near her with interested eyes.</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">LOCK WILLOW( 柳树 ) FARM,</p>
<p class="text-left">August 3rd</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">It has been nearly two months since I wrote.</p>
<p class="text-left">It wasn’t nice of me, I know, but I haven’t loved you much this summer—you see I’m being honest!</p>
<p class="text-left">You can’t imagine how disappointed( 失望的 ) I was at having to give up the McBrides’ camp.</p>
<p class="text-left">Of course I know that you’re my guardian( 监护人 ), and that I have to respect your wishes.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I couldn’t see any reason.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was so obviously the best thing for me.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I were you and you were me, I would have said, “Bless( 保佑 ) you my child, run along and have a good time.</p>
<p class="text-left">See lots of new people and learn lots of new things.</p>
<p class="text-left">Live out of doors, and get strong and well and rested for a year of hard work.”</p>
<p class="text-left">But not at all!</p>
<p class="text-left">Just a short note from your secretary ordering me to Lock Willow.</p>
<p class="text-left">Even when you give me orders, you keep your distance.</p>
<p class="text-left">That’s what hurts my feelings( 感情 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">If you felt for me even a little bit of what I feel for you, you would sometimes send me a message that you’d written with your own hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">Instead, I get those horrible( 可怕的 ) typed secretary’s notes.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you gave me the slightest sign that you cared, I’d do anything on earth to please you.</p>
<p class="text-left">I know that I was to write nice, long letters without ever expecting any answer.</p>
<p class="text-left">You’re keeping your side of the agreement—I’m being educated—and I suppose you’re thinking I’m not keeping mine!</p>
<p class="text-left">But, Daddy, it’s hard.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m so awfully lonely.</p>
<p class="text-left">You are the only person I have to care for, and you are so shadowy( 神秘的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">You’re just an imaginary man that I’ve made up—and probably the real you isn’t a bit like my imaginary you.</p>
<p class="text-left">But you did once send me a message, when I was ill.</p>
<p class="text-left">And now, when I am feeling forgotten, I get out your card and read it again.</p>
<p class="text-left">What I started to say, and really meant to say, was this:</p>
<p class="text-left">My feelings are still hurt.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t like to be picked up and moved about by an unreasonable, invisible( 无形的 ) Providence.</p>
<p class="text-left">Still, when a man has been as kind and generous( 慷慨的 ) and thoughtful as you have always been to me, I suppose he has a right to be an unreasonable, invisible Providence if he chooses.</p>
<p class="text-left">So I’ll forgive( 原谅 ) you and be cheerful again.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I still don’t enjoy getting Sallie’s letters about the good times they are having in camp!</p>
<p class="text-left">However—we will forget all that and begin again.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve been writing a lot this summer.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have finished four short stories, and sent them to four different magazines.</p>
<p class="text-left">So you see I’m trying to be an author.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have set up a study in the attic( 阁楼 ), where Master( 老爷 ) Jervie used to play.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s in a cool, breezy( 通风好的 ) corner with two windows, shaded( 被遮蔽 ) by a tree.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ll write a nicer letter in a few days, and tell you all the farm news.</p>
<p class="text-left">We need rain.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours as ever,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">August 10th</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">SIR: I am writing to you from a fork in the tree by the pool.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve been here for an hour; it’s very comfortable, especially as I’ve brought two cushions( 靠垫 ) with me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I came up with a pen and paper, hoping to write a famous short story.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I’ve been having problems with my heroine( 女主人公 )—I can’t make her do what I want her to do.</p>
<p class="text-left">So I’ve left her for the moment, and am writing to you. (Not much better though, for I can’t make you do what I want, either.)</p>
<p class="text-left">If you are in that dreadful( 糟糕的 ) New York, I wish I could send you some of this lovely fresh weather.</p>
<p class="text-left">The country is Heaven( 天堂 ) after a week of rain.</p>
<p class="text-left">During our week of rain I read a lot—Stevenson, mostly.</p>
<p class="text-left">He himself is more interesting than any of the characters in his books.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think he made himself into the hero of his own adventure( 历险 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t you think it was perfect of him to spend all the ten thousand dollars his father left him on a sailing( 起航的 ) boat, and go sailing off to the South Seas?</p>
<p class="text-left">He lived up to his belief in adventure.</p>
<p class="text-left">If my father had left me ten thousand dollars, I’d do it, too.</p>
<p class="text-left">The thought of Vailima makes me wild.</p>
<p class="text-left">I want to see the tropics( 热带地区 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I want to see the whole world.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am going to be a great author, or artist, or actress—or whatever sort of a great person I turn out to be.</p>
<p class="text-left">I really want to travel; the very sight of a map makes me want to put on my hat and take an umbrella and start.</p>
<p class="text-left">Our nine young pigs crossed the river and ran away last Tuesday, and only eight came back.</p>
<p class="text-left">We don’t want to accuse( 指责 ) anyone unjustly( 不公正地 ), but we believe that Widow( 寡妇 ) Dowd has one more than she ought to have.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have a new hat that I bought for twenty-five cents at the post office.</p>
<p class="text-left">This is a picture of me, on my way to rake( 耙 ) the hay( 干草 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s getting too dark to see; anyway, the news is all used up.</p>
<p class="text-left">Good night,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">Friday</p>
<p class="text-left">Good morning!</p>
<p class="text-left">Here is some news!</p>
<p class="text-left">What do you think?</p>
<p class="text-left">You’d never, never, never guess who’s coming to Lock Willow.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Pendleton wrote to Mrs. Semple, saying that he’s driving through the Berkshires, and is tired and wants to rest on a nice quiet farm.</p>
<p class="text-left">If he shows up here some night, will she have a room ready for him?</p>
<p class="text-left">Maybe he’ll stay one week, or maybe two, or maybe three.</p>
<p class="text-left">He’ll see how restful it is when he gets here.</p></div>

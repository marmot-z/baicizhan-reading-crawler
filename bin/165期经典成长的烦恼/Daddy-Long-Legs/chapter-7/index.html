<p class="text-left">Towards the end of the Christmas vacation.</p>
<p class="text-left">Exact date unknown</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Is it snowing where you are?</p>
<p class="text-left">Everything that I see from my tower is covered in white, and the snowflakes( 雪花 ) are coming down as big as popcorn( 爆米花 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s late afternoon—the sun is just setting (a cold yellow color) behind some colder blue hills.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am up in my window seat, using the last light to write to you.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your five gold pieces were a surprise!</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m not used to receiving Christmas presents.</p>
<p class="text-left">You have already given me such lots of things—everything I have, you know—that I don’t quite feel that I deserve( 应得 ) anything more.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I like them, just the same.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you want to know what I bought with my money?</p>
<p class="text-left">1. A watch to get me to class in time.</p>
<p class="text-left">2. Matthew Arnold’s poems.</p>
<p class="text-left">3. A hot water bottle.</p>
<p class="text-left">4. A warm blanket( 毯子 ) to wrap( 用...包 ) around me. (My tower is cold.)</p>
<p class="text-left">5. Five hundred sheets( 张 ) of yellow writing paper. (I’m going to start being an author pretty soon.)</p>
<p class="text-left">6. A dictionary of synonyms( 同义词 ) (to enlarge the author’s vocabulary( 词汇量 )).</p>
<p class="text-left">7. (I don’t much like to tell you this last one, but I will.) A pair of silk stockings( 长筒袜 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">And now, Daddy, never say I don’t tell all!</p>
<p class="text-left">To be honest, I had a very wrong reason for buying the silk stockings.</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia Pendleton comes into my room to do geometry( 几何学 ), and she wears silk stockings every night.</p>
<p class="text-left">But just wait—as soon as she gets back from vacation I shall go to her room in my silk stockings.</p>
<p class="text-left">You see, Daddy, I’m not a good person, but at least I’m honest.</p>
<p class="text-left">You knew already, from my record at the Home, that I wasn’t perfect, didn’t you?</p>
<p class="text-left">To sum( 总结 ) up (that’s the way the English instructor begins every other sentence), I am very grateful( 感激的 ) for my seven presents.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m pretending( 假装 ) to myself that they came in a box from my family in California.</p>
<p class="text-left">The watch is from father, and the blanket from mother.</p>
<p class="text-left">The hot water bottle is from grandmother, who is always afraid I will catch cold.</p>
<p class="text-left">The yellow paper is from my little brother Harry.</p>
<p class="text-left">My sister Isabel gave me the silk stockings, and Aunt Susan gave me the Matthew Arnold poems.</p>
<p class="text-left">Uncle Harry (little Harry is named after him) gave me the dictionary.</p>
<p class="text-left">He wanted to send chocolates, but I said that I must have synonyms.</p>
<p class="text-left">You don’t object, do you, to playing the part of a whole family?</p>
<p class="text-left">And now, shall I tell you about my vacation, or are you only interested in my education?</p>
<p class="text-left">The girl from Texas is named Leonora Fenton.</p>
<p class="text-left">I like her, but not so much as Sallie McBride.</p>
<p class="text-left">I shall never like any one so much as Sallie—except you. I must always like you the best of all, because you’re my whole family combined( 合并 ) into one.</p>
<p class="text-left">Leonora and I and two second-year girls have walked across the fields every pleasant day.</p>
<p class="text-left">We have explored( 探索 ) the whole neighborhood, dressed in short skirts and jackets and caps, and carrying sticks to protect ourselves with if we have to.</p>
<p class="text-left">Once we walked into town—four miles—and stopped at a restaurant where the college girls go for dinner.</p>
<p class="text-left">Baked( 烘烤的 ) lobster( 龙虾 ) (35 cents), and for dessert( 甜点 ), pancakes and maple syrup( 槭糖浆 ) (15 cents). Filling and cheap.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was such fun! Especially for me, because it was so different from the Home.</p>
<p class="text-left">I feel like an escaped( 逃跑的 ) prisoner( 犯人 ) every time I leave the college grounds.</p>
<p class="text-left">Before I thought, I started to tell the others what an experience I was having.</p>
<p class="text-left">The cat was almost out of the bag when I got hold of it by its tail and pulled it back.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s awfully hard for me not to tell everything I know.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m a very talkative( 健谈的 ) person by nature.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I didn’t have you to tell things to, I’d burst( 爆发 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">We had a candy pull last Friday evening, given by the matron( 女舍监 ) of Fergussen for all the girls who haven’t gone home for Christmas.</p>
<p class="text-left">There were twenty-two of us, first-, second-, third- and fourth-year girls all working happily together.</p>
<p class="text-left">The kitchen is huge, with pots( 锅 ) hanging in rows on the stone wall—even the smallest of them is large enough to wash clothes in.</p>
<p class="text-left">Four hundred girls live in Fergussen.</p>
<p class="text-left">The cook wore a white cap and an apron( 围裙 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He gave us twenty-two other white caps and aprons—I can’t imagine where he got so many.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then we all pretended to be cooks.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was great fun, though I have seen better candy.</p>
<p class="text-left">When it was finally finished, we and the kitchen and the door-knobs were sticky( 黏糊糊的 ) all over.</p>
<p class="text-left">We organized a procession, still in our caps and aprons.</p>
<p class="text-left">We marched through the empty corridors( 走廊 ) to the staff room, where the teachers were having a peaceful evening.</p>
<p class="text-left">We sang college songs to them and offered them candy.</p>
<p class="text-left">They accepted politely but rather doubtfully.</p>
<p class="text-left">We left them chewing( 嚼 ) our candy, sticky and speechless.</p>
<p class="text-left">So you see, Daddy, my education progresses!</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t you think that I ought to be an artist instead of an author?</p>
<p class="text-left">Vacation will be over in two days and I shall be glad to see the girls again.</p>
<p class="text-left">My tower is a little lonely; when nine people are living in a house that was built for four hundred, they do rattle( 在空荡的...居住 ) around a bit.</p>
<p class="text-left">Eleven pages—poor Daddy, you must be tired!</p>
<p class="text-left">I meant this to be just a short little thank-you note—but when I get started I seem to have a busy pen.</p>
<p class="text-left">Goodbye, and thank you for thinking of me—I should be perfectly happy except for one little cloud on the horizon( 地平线 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Examinations come in February.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours with love,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S( 附言 ). Maybe it isn’t proper to send love?</p>
<p class="text-left">If it isn’t, please excuse.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I must love somebody and there’s only you and Mrs. Lippett to choose between, so you see—you’ll have to put up with it, Daddy dear, because I can’t love her.</p></div>

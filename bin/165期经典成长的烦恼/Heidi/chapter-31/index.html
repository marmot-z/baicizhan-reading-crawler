                        <div><p class="text-left">Heidi now called to him to come down, but as reply he only said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Shan’t come.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But you must; come quickly, for I want you to help me. Quickly!” urged( 催促 ) the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Don’t want to,” was the reply.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi hurried up the mountain now and shouted angrily to the boy:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Peter, if you don’t come this minute, I shall do something that you won’t like.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Those words scared( 使惊吓 ) Peter, for he knew he had done something wrong.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had thought himself safe till this moment, when Heidi seemed to talk as if she knew it all.</p>
<p class="text-left">What if the grandfather should hear about it!</p>
<p class="text-left">Shaking with fear, Peter obeyed( 听从 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“I shall only come if you promise not to do what you said,” insisted( 坚持 ) the boy.</p>
<p class="text-left">“No, no, I won’t. Don’t be afraid,” said Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Just come along; it isn’t so hard.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter, on approaching Clara, was told to help raise the child from the ground on one side, while Heidi helped on the other.</p>
<p class="text-left">This went easily enough, but difficulties soon followed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara was not able to stand alone, and how could they get any further?</p>
<p class="text-left">“You must put one arm around my neck, and put the other around Peter’s and lean( 靠 ) firmly upon it,</p>
<p class="text-left">then we shall be able to carry you!” said Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">The boy, who had never offered his arm to anybody in his life,</p>
<p class="text-left">had to be shown how to do so first, before further efforts could be made.</p>
<p class="text-left">But it was too hard. Clara tried to set her feet forward, but she lost hope.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Press your feet on the ground more and I am sure it will hurt you less,” suggested Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you think so?” said Clara, nervously.</p>
<p class="text-left">But, obeying, she put her foot on the ground more firmly and soon another, giving a little cry as she went.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, it really has hurt me less,” she said joyfully( 高兴地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Try it again,” Heidi urged her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara did, and took another step, and then another, and another still.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly she cried aloud:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Heidi, I can do it. Oh, I really can. Just look! I can take steps, one after another.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi exclaimed( 大声喊叫 ):</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Clara, can you really? Can you take steps now? Oh, if only grandfather would come!</p>
<p class="text-left">Now you can walk, Clara, now you can walk,” she kept on saying joyfully.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara held on tight( 紧紧地 ) to the children, but with every new step she became more firm.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now you can come up here every day,” cried Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now we can walk wherever we want to, and you don’t have to be pushed in a chair anymore.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now you’ll be able to walk all your life. Oh, what joy!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara’s greatest wish, to be well like other people, had been fulfilled( 实现 ) at last.</p>
<p class="text-left">The two children could hardly believe this happiness that had come to them.</p>
<p class="text-left">It filled their hearts and made them silent.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thus the hours flew, and the day was long past noon.</p>
<p class="text-left">Soon after, the grandfather was seen climbing up the Alp.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi ran to meet him, telling him of the great event.</p>
<p class="text-left">The old man’s face shone at this news. Going over to Clara, he said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“So you have risked it? Now we have won.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then picking her up, he put one arm around her waist( 腰 ), and he held out the other one as support.</p>
<p class="text-left">With his help she marched more firmly than ever.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi jumped happily by their side.</p>
<p class="text-left">In all this excitement the grandfather did not lose his judgement( 判断 ), and before long he lifted Clara on his arm to carry her home.</p>
<p class="text-left">He knew that tiring her too much would be dangerous, and rest was needed for the girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter, arriving in the village late that day, saw many people talking together.</p>
<p class="text-left">They were all standing about an interesting object, and everybody pushed and fought for a chance to get nearest.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was no other than the chair.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I saw it when they carried it up,” Peter heard the baker( 面包师 ) say.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am sure it was worth a lot of money. I should just like to know how it has happened.</p>
<p class="text-left">“When the gentleman from Frankfurt hears what has happened,</p>
<p class="text-left">he’ll surely find out all about it, and I should pity whoever did it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am glad I haven’t been up on the Alp for so long! Otherwise they might suspect( 怀疑 ) me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Many more opinions were shared, but Peter had heard enough.</p>
<p class="text-left">He quietly slipped away( 溜走 ) and went home.</p>
<p class="text-left">What if they should find out he had done it?</p>
<p class="text-left">A policeman might arrive any time now and they might take him away to prison( 监狱 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter’s hair stood up on end at this alarming( 令人忧虑的 ) thought.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was so troubled when he came home that he did not answer any questions and even refused his dish of potatoes.</p>
<p class="text-left">Hurriedly, he got into bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Next morning a letter was written to grandmama, inviting her to come up to the Alp within a week.</p>
<p class="text-left">The children had planned to surprise her with the news.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara hoped then to be able to walk alone, with Heidi as her guide.</p>
<p class="text-left">The following days were happier still for Clara.</p>
<p class="text-left">She progressed, and took longer walks every day.</p>
<p class="text-left">She got hungrier every day, and the grandfather had to make larger slices( 片 ) of the bread and butter( 黄油 ) that, to his delight( 高兴 ), disappeared so rapidly.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had to fill bowl after bowl of the warm milk for the hungry children.</p>
<p class="text-left">In that way they reached the end of the week that was to bring the grandmama.</p></div>

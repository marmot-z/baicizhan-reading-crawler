                        <div><p class="text-left">Sara stayed with her father at his hotel for several days until he sailed away again to India.</p>
<p class="text-left">They went out and visited many shops together, and bought a great many things.</p>
<p class="text-left">They bought, indeed, a great many more things than Sara needed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Captain Crewe was a foolish, innocent young man and wanted his little girl to have everything she admired, and everything he admired himself.</p>
<p class="text-left">Between them they collected a wardrobe( 衣柜 ) much too grand for a child of seven.</p>
<p class="text-left">There were velvet( 天鹅绒的 ) and lace( 蕾丝 ) dresses, and hats with great, soft bird feathers, coats, and boxes of tiny gloves and handkerchiefs( 手帕 ) and silk stockings( 长袜 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">And at last they found Emily.</p>
<p class="text-left">They had passed two or three places without even going in.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then, as they were approaching a rather small shop, Sara suddenly started and touched her father’s arm.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, papa!” she cried. “There is Emily!”</p>
<p class="text-left">There was an expression in her green-gray eyes as if she had just seen someone she was fond of.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is actually waiting there for us!” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Let us go in to her.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She was a large doll, but not too large to carry about easily.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had naturally curling( 卷曲的 ) golden brown hair.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her eyes were gray-blue, with soft, thick eyelashes which were real eyelashes and not mere painted lines.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Of course,” said Sara, looking into her face as she held her on her knee, “of course papa, this is Emily.”</p>
<p class="text-left">So Emily was bought and taken to a children’s outfitter’s shop and measured for a wardrobe as grand as Sara’s own.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had lace and velvet dresses, too, and hats and coats and beautiful underwear( 内衣 ) and gloves and handkerchiefs and furs.</p>
<p class="text-left">Captain Crewe would really have enjoyed the shopping, but that a sad thought kept pulling at his heart.</p>
<p class="text-left">This all meant that he was going to be separated from his beloved( 心爱的 ) little companion.</p>
<p class="text-left">He got out of his bed in the middle of that night and stood looking down at Sara, who lay asleep with Emily in her arms.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Little Sara!” he said to himself.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t believe you know how much your daddy will miss you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The next day he took her to Miss Minchin’s and left her there.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was to sail away the next morning.</p>
<p class="text-left">He explained to Miss Minchin that his lawyers, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Skipworth, had charge of his affairs in England.</p>
<p class="text-left">They would pay the bills she sent in for Sara’s expenses.</p>
<p class="text-left">He would write to Sara twice a week, and she was to be given every pleasure she asked for.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is a wise little thing, and she always knows what is best for her well-being,” he said.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he went with Sara into her little sitting room and they said goodbye.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara sat on his knee and held onto the front of his coat in her small hands, and looked long and hard at his face.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are you learning me by heart, little Sara?” he said, touching her hair.</p>
<p class="text-left">“No,” she answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I know you by heart. You are inside my heart.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And they put their arms round each other as if they would never let each other go.</p>
<p class="text-left">After the cab had driven away with Captain Crewe in it, Miss Minchin sent her sister, Miss Amelia, to see what the child was doing.</p>
<p class="text-left">Amelia found she could not open the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have locked it,” said a polite little voice from inside.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I want to be by myself, if you please.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Amelia was fat and short, and stood very afraid of her sister.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was the more agreeable person of the two, but she never disobeyed( 违背 ) Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">She went downstairs again, looking almost alarmed.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I never saw such a funny, old-fashioned child, sister,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She has locked herself in, and she is not making any noise.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is much better than if she kicked and screamed, as some of them do,” Miss Minchin answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I expected that a child as much spoiled( 被宠坏的 ) as she is would make quite a scene.</p>
<p class="text-left">If ever a child was given her own way in everything, she is.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’ve been opening her trunks and putting her things away,” said Miss Amelia.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I never saw anything like them.</p>
<p class="text-left">You have seen some of her clothes.</p>
<p class="text-left">What do you think of them?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I think they are perfectly ridiculous( 可笑的 ),” replied Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But they will look very well at the head of the line when we take the children to church on Sunday.</p>
<p class="text-left">She has been provided for as if she were a little princess.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And upstairs( 在楼上 ) in the locked room Sara and Emily sat on the floor.</p>
<p class="text-left">She stared at the corner round which the cab had disappeared, while Captain Crewe looked back, waving and kissing his hand as if he could not bear to stop.</p></div>

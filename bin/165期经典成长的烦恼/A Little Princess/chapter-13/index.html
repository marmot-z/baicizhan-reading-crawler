                        <div><p class="text-left">“Sara,” she said, “your papa’s lawyer, Mr. Barrow, has called to see Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">She must talk to him alone and your food is laid in her parlor( 客厅 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">So you had all better come and have your meal now, so that my sister can have her interview here in the classroom.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Amelia directed the orderly procession, and told Becky to go back to her work.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara led them all away, leaving the Last Doll sitting upon a chair with her wardrobe all about her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin came into the room, with a little gentleman, who looked rather troubled.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin herself also looked rather troubled.</p>
<p class="text-left">She sat down, and waved him to a chair.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Please be seated, Mr. Barrow,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Barrow did not sit down at once.</p>
<p class="text-left">His attention seemed attracted by the Last Doll and the things around her.</p>
<p class="text-left">He put on his eyeglasses and looked at them in dislike.</p>
<p class="text-left">“A hundred pounds,” Mr. Barrow remarked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He spent too much money, that young man.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I beg your pardon, Mr. Barrow,” she said with confusion( 困惑 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“I do not understand.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Birthday presents,” said Mr. Barrow, “to a child of eleven years old! Mad waste, I call it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin drew herself up still more firmly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Captain Crewe is a man of fortune,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The diamond mines alone—”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Diamond mines!” he broke out.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There are none! Never were!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin actually got up from her chair.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What!” she cried. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“When a man is not a businessman himself, he had better keep away from his dear friend’s so-called diamond mines. The late Captain Crewe—”</p>
<p class="text-left">Here Miss Minchin stopped him suddenly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The late Captain Crewe!” she cried out.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The late! You don’t come to tell me that Captain Crewe is—”</p>
<p class="text-left">“He’s dead, ma’am,” Mr. Barrow answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Died of jungle fever( 丛林热 ) and business troubles together.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin dropped into her chair again.</p>
<p class="text-left">The words he had spoken filled her with fear.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That young man had too much money.</p>
<p class="text-left">The friend was mad about the diamond mine.</p>
<p class="text-left">He put all his own money into it, and all Captain Crewe’s.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then the friend ran away—Captain Crewe was already sick with fever when the news came.</p>
<p class="text-left">The shock was too much for him.</p>
<p class="text-left">He died speaking wildly about his little girl—and didn’t leave a penny.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Never had Miss Minchin received such a blow in her life.</p>
<p class="text-left">She felt as if she had been robbed, and that Captain Crewe and Sara and Mr. Barrow were equally to blame.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you mean to tell me,” she cried out, “that he left nothing!</p>
<p class="text-left">That Sara will have no fortune!</p>
<p class="text-left">That she is left on my hands a little beggar instead of an heiress?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is certainly left a beggar,” he replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And she is certainly left on your hands, ma’am—as she hasn’t a relation in the world that we know of.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is unjust!” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She’s in my sitting room at this moment, giving a party at my expense.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was always so sure of his payments that I went to all sorts of ridiculous expenses for the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">I paid the bills for that ridiculous doll and her ridiculous wardrobe.</p>
<p class="text-left">The child was to have anything she wanted.</p>
<p class="text-left">She has a carriage and a pony and a maid, and I’ve paid for all of them since the last cheque came.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Barrow was not interested in listening to Miss Minchin’s complaints( 抱怨 ) after he had made his position clear.</p>
<p class="text-left">Nor did he feel particularly sorry for angry keepers of boarding schools.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You had better not pay for anything more, ma’am,” he remarked, “unless you want to make presents to the young lady.</p>
<p class="text-left">She hasn’t any money to call her own.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But what am I to do?” demanded Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There isn’t anything to do,” said Mr. Barrow.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Captain Crewe is dead. The child is left without money. Nobody is responsible for( 负有责任的 ) her but you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am not responsible for her, and I refuse to be made responsible!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin became quite white with anger.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Barrow turned to go.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have nothing to do with that, madam,” he said without feeling.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Barrow & Skipworth are not responsible. Very sorry the thing has happened, of course.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“If you think I will take care of her, you are greatly mistaken,” Miss Minchin said forcefully.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have been robbed and cheated; I will turn her into the street!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Barrow moved toward the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I wouldn’t do that, madam,” he commented, “it wouldn’t look well. Unpleasant story for the school. Pupil sent out penniless and without friends.”</p>
<p class="text-left">He was a clever businessman, and he knew what he was saying.</p>
<p class="text-left">He also knew that Miss Minchin would be smart enough to see the truth.</p>
<p class="text-left">She could not afford to do a thing which would make people speak of her as cruel and hard-hearted( 铁石心肠的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Better keep her and make use of her,” he added.</p>
<p class="text-left">He bowed himself out and closed the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">What he had said was quite true.</p>
<p class="text-left">She knew it. She had absolutely( 绝对地 ) no choice.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her show pupil had disappeared into nothingness, leaving only a lonely, little girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">All the money she had spent on Sara was lost and could not be returned.</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">Clara was painfully surprised and tried to prevent( 防止 ) her father from carrying out his plan.</p>
<p class="text-left">He remained firm, however, promising to take her to Switzerland( 瑞士，地名 ) himself the following summer, if she was good and sensible( 理智的 ) now.</p>
<p class="text-left">So the child gave up and begged( 乞求 ) to have Heidi’s trunk( 旅行箱 ) prepared in her room.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann encouraged her to get together good clothes to wear for her little friend.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sebastian was told to get ready for travelling with the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was to go to Basle that day and spend the night at a good hotel which his master( 主人 ) named.</p>
<p class="text-left">The next day the child was to be brought to her home.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was dressed in her Sunday dress( 某人最好的衣服 ) and stood waiting for further orders</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann called her now.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Good morning, Mr. Sesemann,” Heidi said when she entered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What do you think about it, little one?” he asked her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi looked up to him in confusion( 疑惑地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“You don’t seem to know anything about it,” laughed Mr. Sesemann,</p>
<p class="text-left">“You are going home today.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Home?” Heidi repeated in a low voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her surprise was so great that she opened her mouth in disbelief.</p>
<p class="text-left">It seemed to her as if it was only a dream.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Go to Clara, Heidi, till the carriage comes,” Mr. Sesemann said kindly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi had been wishing to go, and now she ran to Clara’s room, where a huge trunk was standing.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Heidi, look at the things I had packed for you. Do you like them?” Clara asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">There were a great many lovely things in it, but Heidi jumped for joy( 欢乐 ) when she discovered a little basket.</p>
<p class="text-left">In it there were twelve round white rolls( 面包卷 ) for the grandmother.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmama’s book was carefully packed, and so was the red scarf that Miss Rottenmeier had purposely left behind when she packed for Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then putting on her pretty hat, she left her room to say goodbye to Clara.</p>
<p class="text-left">She thanked Mr. Sesemann for all his goodness.</p>
<p class="text-left">She also sent a message of thanks to the good old doctor, whom she believed to be the real cause of her going.</p>
<p class="text-left">Only when Heidi was sitting in the train did she become aware of where she was going.</p>
<p class="text-left">She knew now that she would really see her grandfather and the grandmother again, also Peter and the goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her only fear was that the poor blind grandmother might have died while she was away.</p>
<p class="text-left">The thing she looked forward to most was giving the soft white rolls to the grandmother.</p>
<p class="text-left">While she was thinking about all these things, she fell asleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">In Basle( 巴赛尔，地名 ) she was awoken by Sebastian, for they were to spend the night there.</p>
<p class="text-left">The next morning they started off again, and it took them many hours before they reached Mayenfeld.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they arrived at the station, Sebastian wished he could have travelled further in the train.</p>
<p class="text-left">He didn’t want to climb a mountain.</p>
<p class="text-left">The last part of the trip might be dangerous, for everything seemed half-wild in this country.</p>
<p class="text-left">When he told Heidi this, she said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I can go up alone from the village. I know the road.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sebastian felt relieved( 放松的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He asked a man to take Heidi’s trunk to the village so that the grandfather could pick it up the next day.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then, calling Heidi to him, he presented her with a heavy roll of bills and a letter for the grandfather.</p>
<p class="text-left">These important things were put at the bottom of the basket, under the rolls, so that they could not possibly get lost.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi promised to be careful of them.</p>
<p class="text-left">The two old friends shook hands and parted.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi began to tremble( 颤抖 ) with excitement when she recognized( 认出 ) all the trees she knew on the road and the peaks( 山顶 ) of the mountains.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was running up the path( 小路 ); from time to time she had to stop, for her basket was heavy and she lost her breath( 喘不过气 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Her one idea was:</p>
<p class="text-left">“If only grandmother still sits in her corner by her spinning( 旋转的 ) wheel!</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, if she should have died!”</p>
<p class="text-left">When the child caught sight of the hut at last, her heart began to beat.</p>
<p class="text-left">The quicker she ran, the more it beat, but at last she tremblingly opened the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Here I am! Grandmother, here I am!” shouted the child,</p>
<p class="text-left">running into the middle of the room and throwing herself on her knees before the old woman.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmother seized( 抓住 ) Heidi’s hands and pulled her close.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was so happy and so surprised that she could only silently touch the child’s curly( 卷的 ) hair over and over again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, yes,” she said at last,</p>
<p class="text-left">“this is Heidi’s hair, and her lovely voice.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Out of her blind eyes big tears( 眼泪 ) of joy( 快乐 ) fell down on Heidi’s hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is it really you, Heidi? Have you really come again?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, yes, grandmother,” the child replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You must not cry, for I have come and will never leave you anymore.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now you won’t have to eat hard black bread anymore for a little while.</p>
<p class="text-left">Look what I have brought you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi put one roll after another on the grandmother’s lap( 大腿 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Ah, child, what a blessing( 福气 ) you bring to me!” the old woman cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But you are my greatest blessing yourself, Heidi!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then, touching the child’s hair and red cheeks( 脸颊 ), she said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Just say one more word, so that I may hear your voice.”</p></div>

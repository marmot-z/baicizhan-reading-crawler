                        <div><p class="text-left">The sun was in its highest point and the wind had almost stopped.</p>
<p class="text-left">Only a soft wind blew on the Alp.</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle now got up and went into the hut.</p>
<p class="text-left">He returned soon with milk, cheese( 奶酪 ), and meat that had been dried in the pure( 纯净的 ) air.</p>
<p class="text-left">The doctor enjoyed his dinner better than any he had ever tasted.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, we must send Clara up here. She could get so strong!” he said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If she would have an appetite( 胃口 ) like mine today, she couldn’t help getting nice and fat.”</p>
<p class="text-left">At this moment, a man could be seen walking up with a large sack( 麻袋 ) on his shoulders.</p>
<p class="text-left">Arriving on top, he threw down his load( 负重 ), breathing( 呼吸 ) in the pure fresh air.</p>
<p class="text-left">Opening the cover, the doctor said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“This has come for you from Frankfurt( 法兰克福，地名 ), Heidi. Come and look what is in it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi shyly watched the pile( 堆 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Only when the gentleman opened the box with the cakes for the grandmother she said joyfully( 高兴地 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, now grandmother can eat this lovely cake.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She was taking the box and the beautiful scarf on her arm.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was going to race down to deliver( 分发 ) the gifts, but the men persuaded( 说服 ) her to stay and unpack( 打开 ) the rest of the gifts.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was very happy when she found all the other things.</p>
<p class="text-left">When it was near sunset( 日落 ), the doctor rose to start on his way down.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather carried the box, the scarf and the sausage( 香肠 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Together they wandered( 走 ) down the mountain side.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they reached Peter’s hut, Heidi was told to go inside and wait for her grandfather there.</p>
<p class="text-left">At parting she asked,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Would you like to come with me up to the pasture( 牧场 ) tomorrow, doctor?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“With pleasure. Goodbye, Heidi,” was the reply.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather had placed all the presents in front of the door, and it took Heidi long to carry in the huge box and the sausage.</p>
<p class="text-left">She put the scarf on the grandmother’s knee.</p>
<p class="text-left">Brigida had silently watched what happened,</p>
<p class="text-left">and could not open her eyes wide enough when she saw the enormous( 巨大的 ) sausage.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had never seen such thing in her life, and now it was hers and she could cut it herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">At this moment Peter came in.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The uncle is coming up behind me, and Heidi must—” that was as far as he got, for his eyes had fastened on( 集中注意力于... ) the sausage.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was too late, and the grandfather called through the open door:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Heidi, come, you must get your sleep.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Saying good night to all of them, he took Heidi by the hand,</p>
<p class="text-left">and under the shining stars they wandered home to their peaceful cottage.</p>
<p class="text-left">Early the next morning the doctor climbed up the mountain in company with Peter and his goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">The friendly gentleman made several attempts to start a conversation with the boy, but the boy hardly answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they arrived on top, they found Heidi already waiting, fresh as the early dawn( 黎明 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are you coming?” asked Peter as usual.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Of course I shall, if the doctor comes with us,” replied the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather, coming out of the hut, greeted( 向...问候 ) the newcomer with great respect.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he went up to Peter, and hung the sack( 麻袋 ) over Peter’s shoulder, which seemed heavier than usual that day.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they had started on their way, the goats were all around Heidi, but she kept urging( 催促 ) them forward.</p>
<p class="text-left">When at last she was walking peacefully by the doctor’s side, she began to tell him many things about the goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">She told him about their strange acts, and about the flowers, rocks and birds they saw.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they arrived at their destination( 目的地 ), time seemed to have flown.</p>
<p class="text-left">All the time Peter was sending many angry glances( 瞥 ) at the doctor, who never even noticed it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now that Heidi had come again to the pasture( 牧场 ) with him, she did nothing but talk to the old gentleman.</p>
<p class="text-left">It made him very cross( 生气的 ) that he was not even able to get near her.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the sun was in its highest point, Peter knew that it was noon.</p>
<p class="text-left">He called over to the other two with all his might:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Time to eat.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When Heidi was getting up to fetch( 拿 ) their lunch, the doctor just asked for a glass of milk, which was all he wanted.</p>
<p class="text-left">The child also decided to only drink the milk, running over to Peter and informing him of their decision.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the boy found that everything in the bag was his, he hurried with his task as never in his life before.</p>
<p class="text-left">But he felt guilty( 感到内疚的 ) about his former anger at the kind gentleman.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi and the doctor had wandered about the pasture till the gentleman had found it was time to go back to the village.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they parted, Heidi waved( 招手 ) to him.</p>
<p class="text-left">From time to time he turned about.</p>
<p class="text-left">Seeing the child still standing there, he had to think of his own little daughter,</p>
<p class="text-left">who used to wave to him like that when he went away from home.</p></div>

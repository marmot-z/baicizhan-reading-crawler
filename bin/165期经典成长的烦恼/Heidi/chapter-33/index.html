                        <div><p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann, climbing further, at last saw his goal( 目标 ) before him.</p>
<p class="text-left">He eagerly( 心切地 ) hurried to see the daughter he loved so much.</p>
<p class="text-left">They had seen him long ago from the hut, and a treat was prepared for him that he never expected.</p>
<p class="text-left">As he made the last steps, he saw two forms coming towards him.</p>
<p class="text-left">A tall girl, with light hair and red face, was holding on to Heidi, whose dark eyes shone with delight( 高兴 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann stopped short, staring( 盯 ) at this scene.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly big tears( 眼泪 ) rushed from his eyes, for this fair girl before him looked the same as Clara’s mother.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann at this moment did not know if he was awake or dreaming.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Papa, don’t you know me anymore?” Clara called with beaming( 眉开眼笑的 ) eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Have I changed so much?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann rushed up to her, folding( 交叠 ) her in his arms.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, you have changed. How is it possible? Is it really true? Is it really you, Clara?”</p>
<p class="text-left">asked the overjoyed( 欣喜若狂的 ) father, hugging( 拥抱 ) her again and again.</p>
<p class="text-left">His mother joined them now, for she wanted to see the happiness of her son.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What do you say to this, my son? Isn’t our surprise finer than yours?” she greeted( 同...打招呼 ) him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But come over to the one who helped us now—I mean the uncle.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, indeed, I also must greet our little Heidi and the Uncle,” said the gentleman, shaking Heidi’s hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Well? Always fresh and happy on the mountain?</p>
<p class="text-left">I guess I don’t need to ask, for no Alpine( 高山的 ) rose can look healthier.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ah, child, what joy this is to me!”</p>
<p class="text-left">With beaming eyes, the child looked at the kind gentleman who had always been so good to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">While the two men, who had at last approached each other, were conversing( 交谈 ), grandmama walked over to the trees.</p>
<p class="text-left">There, under the fir( 冷杉 ) trees, another surprise awaited( 等待 ) her.</p>
<p class="text-left">A lot of beautiful blue flowers stood as if they had grown there.</p>
<p class="text-left">“How excellent, how wonderful! What a sight!” she shouted, clapping( 拍 ) her hands.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Heidi, come here! Have you brought me those? Oh, they are beautiful!”</p>
<p class="text-left">The children had joined her. Heidi told her that it was another person’s deed( 行为 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">At that moment a sound was heard, and they saw Peter, who was trying to go up behind the trees to avoid the hut.</p>
<p class="text-left">Immediately the old lady called to him, for she thought that Peter himself had picked the flowers for her.</p>
<p class="text-left">He must be creeping( 爬 ) away out of modesty( 谦逊 ), the kind lady thought.</p>
<p class="text-left">To give him his reward( 报酬 ), she called:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come here, my boy! Don’t be afraid.”</p>
<p class="text-left">With his hair standing up on end, Peter approached.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come straight to me, boy,” the old lady encouraged him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now tell me, boy, if you have done that.”</p>
<p class="text-left">In his anxiety( 焦急 ), Peter did not see the grandmama’s finger that pointed to the flowers.</p>
<p class="text-left">He only saw the uncle standing near the hut, watching him closely,</p>
<p class="text-left">and beside him was the policeman, the person he was most afraid of.</p>
<p class="text-left">Trembling( 颤抖 ) in his whole body, Peter answered,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Well, but what are you so frightened( 感到害怕的 ) about?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Because—because it is broken and can never be mended( 被修补 ) again,” Peter said, with his knees shaking under him.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmama now walked over to the hut:</p>
<p class="text-left">“My dear uncle,” she asked kindly,</p>
<p class="text-left">“is this poor boy out of his mind?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Not at all,” was the reply;</p>
<p class="text-left">“only the boy was the wind which blew away the wheelchair.</p>
<p class="text-left">He is expecting the punishment he well deserves( 应得 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandmama was very much surprised, for she thought that Peter looked like he would not do something like that.</p>
<p class="text-left">Why should he have destroyed( 破坏 ) the chair?</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle told her that he had noticed many signs of anger in the boy since Clara had arrived on the Alp.</p>
<p class="text-left">He told the grandmama that he had suspected( 怀疑 ) the boy from the beginning.</p>
<p class="text-left">“My dear uncle,” the old lady said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“we must not punish him further. We must be just.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was very hard on him when Clara took Heidi from him, who is and was his greatest treasure.</p>
<p class="text-left">When he had to sit alone day after day, he got angrier and angrier, which drove him to this bad act.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was rather foolish( 愚蠢的 ), but we all get so when we get angry.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The lady walked over to the boy again, who was still trembling with fear.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sitting down on the bench( 长凳 ), she began:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come, Peter, I’ll tell you something.</p>
<p class="text-left">Stop trembling and listen. You pushed the chair down, to destroy it.</p>
<p class="text-left">You knew very well that it was bad and deserved punishment.</p>
<p class="text-left">But you have made a mistake by thinking that you would hurt Clara by destroying her chair.</p>
<p class="text-left">It has happened that what you have done has been the greatest good for her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She would probably never have tried to walk, if her chair had been there.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now tell me if you have a wish, my boy, for I am going to give you something to remember your friends from Frankfurt.</p>
<p class="text-left">What is it? What would you like to have?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter, lifting his head, stared at the grandmama with round, astonished( 震惊的 ) eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">He would get rewarded instead of punished!</p></div>

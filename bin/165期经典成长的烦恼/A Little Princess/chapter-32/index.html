                        <div><p class="text-left">Sara looked toward Ram Dass, who stood near the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Shall I give him to the Lascar?” she asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“How do you know he is a Lascar?” said the Indian gentleman, smiling a little.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, I know Lascars,” Sara said, handing over the monkey.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I was born in India.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The Indian gentleman sat up so suddenly that she was for a moment quite surprised.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You were born in India,” he cried, “were you? Come here.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And he held out his hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara went to him and laid her hand in his.</p>
<p class="text-left">She stood still, and her green-gray eyes met his wonderingly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Something seemed to be the matter with him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You live next door?” he demanded.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes; I live at Miss Minchin’s school.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But you are not one of her pupils?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara stopped a moment.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t know exactly what I am,” she replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why not?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“At first I was a pupil, but now—”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You were a pupil! What are you now?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I sleep in the attic,” she said with a sad smile.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I run errands for the cook, and I teach the little ones their lessons.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Question her, Carmichael,” said Mr. Carrisford, sitting back as if he had lost his strength.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I cannot.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The kind father of the Large Family spoke to her in a nice, encouraging voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What do you mean by ‘At first,’ my child?” he asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“When I was first taken there by my papa.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Where is your papa?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“He died,” said Sara, very quietly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He lost all his money and there was none left for me.</p>
<p class="text-left">There was no one to take care of me or to pay Miss Minchin.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“How did your father lose his money?” the Indian gentleman broke in impatiently( 不耐地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“He did not lose it himself,” Sara answered, wondering still more each moment.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He had a friend he was very fond of.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was his friend who took his money.</p>
<p class="text-left">He trusted his friend too much.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The Indian gentleman’s breath came more quickly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The friend might have meant to do no harm,” he said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It might have happened through a mistake.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“The suffering was just as bad for my papa,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It killed him.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“What was your father’s name?” the Indian gentleman said. “Tell me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“His name was Ralph Crewe,” Sara answered, feeling unsure.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Captain Crewe.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Ram Dass sprang to his master’s side.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Carmichael,” the sick man cried out, “it is the child—the child!”</p>
<p class="text-left">For a moment Sara thought he was going to die.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ram Dass poured out drops from a bottle, and held them to his lips.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara stood near, trembling( 颤抖 ) a little.</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked in a confused way at Mr. Carmichael.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What child am I?” she asked in confusion.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He was your father’s friend,” Mr. Carmichael answered her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Don’t be frightened.</p>
<p class="text-left">We have been looking for you for two years.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara put her hand up to her forehead, and her mouth shook.</p>
<p class="text-left">She spoke as if she were in a dream.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And I was at Miss Minchin’s all the while,” she half whispered, “just on the other side of the wall.”</p>
<p class="text-left">It was pretty Mrs. Carmichael who explained everything.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was sent for at once, and came across the square.</p>
<p class="text-left">She took Sara into her warm arms and made clear to her all that had happened.</p>
<p class="text-left">The excitement of the discovery had been almost dangerous to Mr. Carrisford in his weak condition.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Upon my word,” he said weakly to Mr. Carmichael, when it was suggested that the little girl should go into another room.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I feel as if I do not want to lose sight of her.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara could only think of one thing.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Was he,” she said, “was he the awful friend? Oh, do tell me!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“He was not awful, my dear,” Mrs. Carmichael answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He did not really lose your papa’s money.</p>
<p class="text-left">He only thought he had lost it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Because he loved your papa so much, his sadness made him so ill that for a time he was not in his right mind.</p>
<p class="text-left">He almost died of brain fever, and long before he began to get well again, your poor papa was dead.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“He believed you were in school in France.</p>
<p class="text-left">He has looked for you everywhere.</p>
<p class="text-left">When he saw you pass by, looking so sad and lonely, he did not dream that you were his friend’s poor child.</p>
<p class="text-left">Because you were a little girl, too, he was sorry for you, and wanted to make you happier.</p>
<p class="text-left">And he told Ram Dass to climb into your attic window and try to make you comfortable.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara gave a start of joy; her whole look changed.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Did Ram Dass bring the things?” she cried out.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Did he tell Ram Dass to do it? Did he make the dream that came true?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, my dear—yes! He is kind and good, and he was sorry for you, in honor of little lost Sara Crewe.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The library door opened and Mr. Carmichael appeared, calling Sara to him with a wave of his hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Mr. Carrisford is better already,” he said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He wants you to come to him.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara did not wait.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the Indian gentleman looked at her as she entered, he saw that her face was all lit up.</p>
<p class="text-left">She stood before his chair, with her hands joined together against her breast.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You sent the things to me,” she said, in a joyful voice, “the beautiful things? You sent them!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, dear child, I did,” he answered her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Then it is you who are my friend!” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">And she dropped her face on his thin hand and kissed it again and again.</p></div>

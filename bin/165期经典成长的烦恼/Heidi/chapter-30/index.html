                        <div><p class="text-left">It was then that Peter noticed the wheelchair standing near the hut.</p>
<p class="text-left">After carefully glancing( 扫视 ) about him, he rushed at the hated object and pushed it down the mountain side.</p>
<p class="text-left">The chair fairly flew away and had soon disappeared.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter felt frightened( 害怕的 ) now, and he raced up the Alp,</p>
<p class="text-left">not daring( 不敢 ) to pause( 停 ) till he had reached a place where he could hide from the uncle.</p>
<p class="text-left">Looking down, he watched his fallen enemy going downwards( 往下走 ), downwards.</p>
<p class="text-left">Pieces were falling from it right and left, and were blown about.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now the stranger would have to go away and Heidi would be his again!</p>
<p class="text-left">But Peter had forgotten that a bad act always brings a punishment.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi just now came out of the hut.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather, with Clara, followed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi at first stood still.</p>
<p class="text-left">And then, running right and left, she returned to the old man.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The wheelchair is gone!” Heidi cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">At this moment, a strong wind was blowing, which violently( 猛烈地 ) closed the workshop( 工场 ) door.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandfather, the wind has done it,” said Heidi eagerly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh dear! If it has fallen all the way down to the village, it will be too late to go today.</p>
<p class="text-left">It will take us a long time to fetch( 拿 ) it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“If it has fallen down there, we shall never get it anymore.</p>
<p class="text-left">It will be broken to pieces,” said the old man,</p>
<p class="text-left">looking down and measuring( 测量 ) the distance from the corner of the hut.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t see how it happened,” he remarked( 说 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“What a shame! Now I’ll never be able to go up to the pasture( 牧场 ),” said Clara sadly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am afraid I’ll have to go home now. What a pity, what a pity!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You can find a way for her to stay, grandfather, can’t you?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“We’ll go up to the pasture today, as we have planned.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then we shall see what further happens.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The children were delighted( 高兴的 ), and the grandfather lost no time in getting ready.</p>
<p class="text-left">First he fetched a pile of( 一堆 ) covers, and seating Clara on a sunny spot( 地方 ) on the dry ground, he got their breakfast.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I wonder why Peter is so late today,” he said, leading his goats outside.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then, lifting Clara up on one strong arm, he carried the covers on the other.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now, march( 前进 )!” he cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The goats come with us.”</p>
<p class="text-left">They were all astonished( 震惊的 ) when, arriving on top,</p>
<p class="text-left">they saw Peter already lying on the ground, with his peaceful goats about him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What did you mean by going by us like that? I’ll teach you!” called the uncle to him.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter was frightened, for he knew the voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Nobody was awake yet,” the boy replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Have you seen the chair?” asked the uncle again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Which?” Peter asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle said no more.</p>
<p class="text-left">Unfolding( 交叠 ) the covers, he put Clara down on the dry grass.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then, when he was certain of Clara’s comfort, he got ready to go home.</p>
<p class="text-left">The three were to stay there till his return in the evening.</p>
<p class="text-left">The sky was a deep blue, and the snow on the peaks( 山顶 ) was shining.</p>
<p class="text-left">The eagle( 鹰 ) was flying above the rocky mountains.</p>
<p class="text-left">The children felt wonderfully happy.</p>
<p class="text-left">They had been sitting quietly for a few hours, getting lost in the beauty about them.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi suddenly began to long for the spot where so many flowers grew.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Clara,” she said hesitatingly( 犹豫地 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">“would you be angry if I went away from you a minute and left you alone?</p>
<p class="text-left">I want to see the flowers; But wait!—”</p>
<p class="text-left">Jumping away, she brought Clara some plants and put them on her lap( 大腿 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Soon after, she returned with little Snowhopper.</p>
<p class="text-left">“So, now you don’t need to be alone,” said Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Clara had told her that it would give her pleasure to be left alone with the goats, Heidi started on her walk.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara slowly handed one leaf after another to the little creature( 生物 ), who trusted her more and more.</p>
<p class="text-left">Coming close to the child, it ate the plants out of her hand. Clara felt such a feeling of satisfaction as she had never experienced before.</p>
<p class="text-left">She loved to sit there on the mountain side with the little goat by her.</p>
<p class="text-left">A great desire rose in her heart that hour.</p>
<p class="text-left">She longed to be her own master( 主人 ) and be able to help others instead of being helped by them.</p>
<p class="text-left">Many other thoughts and ideas rushed through her mind.</p>
<p class="text-left">The world seemed so joyous( 欢乐的 ) and wonderful all of a sudden.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi in the meantime( 同时 ) had reached the spot.</p>
<p class="text-left">As she had expected, the whole ground was covered with yellow roses.</p>
<p class="text-left">The flowers were nodding gently in the soft wind.</p>
<p class="text-left">But all the perfume( 香气 ) that filled the air came from the tiny little brown flowers that hid their heads between the golden flowers.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi stood without moving, breathing( 呼吸 ) in the perfumed( 芳香的 ) air.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly she turned and ran back to Clara, shouting to her from far:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, you must come, Clara, it is so lovely there.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the evening it won’t be so fine anymore.</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t you think I could carry you?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But Heidi,” Clara said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“of course you can’t; you are much smaller than I am. Oh, I wish I could walk!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi thought for a little while.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter was still lying on the ground.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had been staring at( 盯着 ) the two children for hours, unable to believe what he saw before him.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had destroyed( 摧毁 ) the chair to get rid of( 摆脱 ) the stranger, and there she was again, sitting right beside his playmate( 玩伴 ).</p></div>

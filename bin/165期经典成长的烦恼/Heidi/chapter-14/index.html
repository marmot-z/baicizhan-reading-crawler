                        <div><p class="text-left">When she had taken leave of the tower-keeper, she asked a boy on the street,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you know where Mr. Sesemann’s house is?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No,” was the reply.</p>
<p class="text-left">She described it as well as she could, till the boy remembered it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Off they started, and soon Heidi found herself pulling the doorbell( 门铃 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">When Sebastian arrived he said, “Hurry up.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi went in, and the boy was left outside, for Sebastian had not even seen him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come up quickly, little Miss,” he urged( 催促 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“They are all waiting for you in the dining room.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Rottenmeier looks very angry. How could you run away like that?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi sat down quietly on her chair.</p>
<p class="text-left">Nobody said a word, and there was an uncomfortable silence.</p>
<p class="text-left">At last Miss Rottenmeier began with a severe( 严厉的 ) and solemn( 庄严的 ) voice:</p>
<p class="text-left">“I shall speak with you later, Adelheid.</p>
<p class="text-left">How can you leave the house without a word?</p>
<p class="text-left">You acted very wrongly. The idea of walking about till so late!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Meow!” was the reply.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I didn’t,” Heidi began—”Meow!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“This is enough,” Miss Rottenmeier tried to say, but she could hardly speak because she was so angry.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Get up and leave the room.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi got up. She began again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I made—” “Meow! Meow! Meow!—”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Heidi,” said Clara now,</p>
<p class="text-left">“why do you always say ‘meow’ again, if you see that Miss Rottenmeier is angry?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am not doing it, it’s the kittens( 小猫 ),” she explained.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What? Cats? Kittens?” screamed( 尖叫 ) the housekeeper( 管家 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Sebastian, take the horrible( 糟糕的 ) things away!”</p>
<p class="text-left">With that she ran into the study, locking herself in, for she feared cats beyond anything on earth.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Sebastian had finished laughing, he came into the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had foreseen( 预见 ) the scene, having caught sight of( 看见 ) the kittens when Heidi came in.</p>
<p class="text-left">The scene was a very peaceful one now; Clara held the little kittens in her lap( 大腿 ), and Heidi was sitting beside her.</p>
<p class="text-left">They both played happily with the two beautiful creatures( 生物 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The butler( 男管家 ) promised to look after the newcomers and prepared a bed for them in a basket.</p>
<p class="text-left">A long time afterward( 之后 ), when it was time to go to bed, Miss Rottenmeier cautiously( 小心地 ) opened the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are they away?” she asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” replied the butler, quickly seizing( 捉住 ) the kittens and taking them away.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Rottenmeier wanted to tell Heidi off, but she waited until the following day, for the lady was too tired after her fright( 恐惧 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">They all went quietly to bed, and the children were happy in the thought that their kittens had a comfortable bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">A short time after the tutor( 家庭教师 ) had arrived next morning, there was a knock at the study door.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sebastian appeared with a large basket, which had been brought for Clara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“We had better have our lesson before we inspect( 检查 ) it,” said Miss Rottenmeier.</p>
<p class="text-left">But Clara turned to the tutor and asked,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, please, Mr. Candidate, can’t we just look shortly, to see what it is?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am afraid that you will think of nothing else,” the teacher began.</p>
<p class="text-left">Just then something in the basket moved, and one, two, three and still more kittens jumped out.</p>
<p class="text-left">They ran around the room with the utmost( 最快的 ) speed.</p>
<p class="text-left">They bounded over the tutor’s boots( 靴子 ) and bit his trousers;</p>
<p class="text-left">they climbed up on Miss Rottenmeier’s dress and crawled( 爬 ) around her feet.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mewing and running, they caused a frightful( 可怕的 ) confusion( 混乱局面 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara called out in delight( 高兴地 ):</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, look at the cute creatures; look how they jump!</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi, look at that one, and oh, see the one over there?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi followed them about, while the teacher shook them off.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the housekeeper collected her wits( 恢复理智 ) after the great fright, she called for the servants.</p>
<p class="text-left">They soon arrived and stored the little kittens safely in the new bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Rottenmeier had found out who was responsible( 负有责任的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">When she was alone with the children in the evening, she began severely:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Adelheid, there is only one punishment for you.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am going to send you to the cellar( 地下室 ), to think about the terrible things you did, in company with the rats( 老鼠 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">A cellar held no terrors( 恐怖 ) for Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">In her grandfather’s cellar, fresh milk and the good cheese( 奶酪 ) had been kept, and no rats had lived there.</p>
<p class="text-left">But Clara shouted:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Miss Rottenmeier, you must wait till Papa comes home, and then he can punish Heidi.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The lady unwillingly replied:</p>
<p class="text-left">“All right, Clara, but I shall also speak a few words to Mr. Sesemann.” With those words she left the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">Since the child’s arrival everything had been upset( 令人心烦的 ), and the lady often felt discouraged( 灰心的 ), though nothing unusual happened for a few days.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara, on the contrary( 相反 ), enjoyed her companion’s society, for she always did funny things.</p>
<p class="text-left">In her lesson she could never get her letters straight.</p>
<p class="text-left">The girls always spent their evenings together, and Heidi would entertain( 使快乐 ) her friend with tales( 故事 ) of her former life.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the end, Heidi’s longing always grew so great that she added:</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have to go home now. I must go tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="text-left">But Clara would say things to make Heidi feel better, and her promise of more rolls( 面包卷 ) for the grandmother made Heidi stay.</p></div>

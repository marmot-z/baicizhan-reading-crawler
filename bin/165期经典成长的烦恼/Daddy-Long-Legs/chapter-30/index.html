                        <div><p class="text-left">Thursday Morning</p>
<p class="text-left">My very Dearest Master-Jervie-Daddy-Long-Legs-Pendleton-Smith,</p>
<p class="text-left">Did you sleep last night? I didn’t.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was too excited and confused( 迷惑的 ) and happy.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t believe I shall ever sleep again—or eat either.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I hope you slept.</p>
<p class="text-left">You must, you know, because then you will get well faster.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can’t bear to think how ill you’ve been—and all the time I never knew it.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the doctor came down yesterday, he told me that for three days they thought you were going to die.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, dearest, if that had happened, the light would have gone out of the world for me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I suppose that someday in the far future, one of us must leave the other.</p>
<p class="text-left">But at least we shall have had our happiness, and there will be memories( 回忆 ) to live with.</p>
<p class="text-left">I meant to cheer you up—and instead I have to cheer myself.</p>
<p class="text-left">For though I’m happier than I ever dreamed I could be, I’m also more serious.</p>
<p class="text-left">The fear that something may happen rests like a shadow( 阴影 ) on my heart.</p>
<p class="text-left">I could always be carefree( 无忧无虑的 ) before, because I had nothing important to lose.</p>
<p class="text-left">But now—I shall have a Great Big Worry all the rest of my life.</p>
<p class="text-left">Whenever you are away from me, I shall be thinking of all the cars that can run over you, or the signboards( 告示牌 ) that can fall on your head, or the bacteria( 细菌 ) that may be making you ill.</p>
<p class="text-left">My peace of mind is gone forever( 永远 )—but I never cared much for just peace.</p>
<p class="text-left">Please get well, fast! I want to have you close by where I can touch you and make sure you are real.</p>
<p class="text-left">Such a short time we had together!</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m afraid maybe I dreamed it.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I were a member of your family (a very distant relative) then I could come and visit you every day.</p>
<p class="text-left">I could read aloud and smooth out those two little wrinkles( 皱纹 ) on your forehead and make the corners of your mouth turn up in a nice cheerful smile.</p>
<p class="text-left">But you are cheerful again, aren’t you?</p>
<p class="text-left">You were yesterday before I left.</p>
<p class="text-left">The doctor said I must be a good nurse, because you looked ten years younger.</p>
<p class="text-left">I hope that being in love doesn’t make every one ten years younger.</p>
<p class="text-left">Will you still care for me, darling( 亲爱的 ), if I turn out to be only eleven?</p>
<p class="text-left">Yesterday was the most wonderful day that could ever happen.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I live to be ninety-nine I shall never forget the tiniest detail( 细节 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The girl who left Lock Willow( 柳树 ) at dawn( 拂晓 ) was a very different person from the one who came back at night.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Semple called me at half past four.</p>
<p class="text-left">I started wide awake in the darkness, and the first thought that came into my head was, “I’m going to see Daddy-Long-Legs!”</p>
<p class="text-left">I ate breakfast in the kitchen by candlelight( 烛光 ), and then drove the five miles to the station through the beautiful colors of the autumn leaves.</p>
<p class="text-left">The sun came up on the way.</p>
<p class="text-left">There was frost( 霜 ) on the ground, and the air was clear and cold and full of promise( 承诺 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I knew something was going to happen.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the train, the rails kept singing, “You’re going to see Daddy-Long-Legs.”</p>
<p class="text-left">It made me feel secure.</p>
<p class="text-left">I had such faith( 信念 ) in Daddy’s ability to set things right.</p>
<p class="text-left">And I knew that somewhere another man—dearer than Daddy—was wanting to see me.</p>
<p class="text-left">And somehow I had a feeling that before the journey ended I should meet him, too. And I did!</p>
<p class="text-left">When I came to the house on Madison Avenue( 麦迪逊大街 ), it looked so big and frightening that I didn’t dare( 敢于 ) to go in.</p>
<p class="text-left">So I walked around the block to get up my courage.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I needn’t have been a bit afraid.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your butler( 男管家 ) is such a nice, fatherly old man that he made me feel at home at once.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is this Miss Abbott?” he said to me,</p>
<p class="text-left">and I said, “Yes,” so I didn’t have to ask for Mr. Smith after all.</p>
<p class="text-left">He told me to wait in the drawing room.</p>
<p class="text-left">I sat down on the edge of a big old chair and kept saying to myself:</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’m going to see Daddy-Long-Legs! I’m going to see Daddy-Long-Legs!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then presently the man came back and asked me please to step up to the library.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was so excited that I could hardly walk.</p>
<p class="text-left">Outside the door he whispered( 低声说 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">“He’s been very ill, Miss.</p>
<p class="text-left">This is the first day he’s been allowed to sit up.</p>
<p class="text-left">You’ll not stay long enough to excite him?”</p>
<p class="text-left">I knew from the way he said it that he loved you—and I think he’s an old dear!</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he knocked and said, “Miss Abbott,” and I went in and the door closed behind me.</p>
<p class="text-left">As I was coming in from the brightly lighted hall, it seemed so dark that for a moment I could hardly see anything.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then I saw a big armchair( 扶手椅 ) before the fire, and a shining tea table with a smaller chair beside it.</p>
<p class="text-left">And I realized that a man was sitting in the big chair with a rug( 毛毯 ) over his knees.</p>
<p class="text-left">Before I could stop him, he rose—rather shakily.</p>
<p class="text-left">He held on to the back of the chair for balance( 平衡 ), and just looked at me without a word.</p>
<p class="text-left">And then—and then—I saw it was you!</p>
<p class="text-left">But even then I didn’t understand.</p>
<p class="text-left">I thought Daddy must have asked you to come.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then you laughed and held out your hand and said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Dear little Judy, couldn’t you guess that I was Daddy-Long-Legs?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, how stupid I have been!</p>
<p class="text-left">A hundred little things might have told me, if I had had any brains.</p>
<p class="text-left">I wouldn’t make a very good detective( 侦探 ), would I, Daddy?</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a very sweet half hour before your doctor came and sent me away.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was so dazed( 晕眩的 ) when I got to the station that I almost took a train for St Louis.</p>
<p class="text-left">And you were pretty dazed, too.</p>
<p class="text-left">You forgot to give me any tea.</p>
<p class="text-left">But we’re both very, very happy, aren’t we?</p>
<p class="text-left">I drove back to Lock Willow in the dark but oh, how the stars were shining!</p>
<p class="text-left">And this morning I’ve been out, visiting all the places that you and I went to together, and remembering what you said and how you looked.</p>
<p class="text-left">The leaves are turning brown, and the air is full of frost.</p>
<p class="text-left">I wish you were here to climb the hills with me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I miss you, Jervie dear, but it’s a happy kind of missing; we’ll be together soon.</p>
<p class="text-left">We belong( 属于 ) to each other now really and truly, no pretending( 假装的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Doesn’t it seem strange for me to belong to someone at last?</p>
<p class="text-left">It seems very, very sweet.</p>
<p class="text-left">And I shall never let you be sorry for a single moment.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours, forever and ever,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S. This is the first love letter I ever wrote.</p>
<p class="text-left">Isn’t it funny that I know how?</p></div>

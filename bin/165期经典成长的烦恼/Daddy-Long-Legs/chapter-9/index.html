<p class="text-left">Mr. D. L. L. Smith,</p>
<p class="text-left">SIR: You never answer any questions; you never show the slightest interest in anything I do.</p>
<p class="text-left">You are probably the nastiest( 最讨厌的 ) one of all those nasty Trustees( 董事 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The reason you are educating me is, not because you care a bit about me, but from a sense of Duty.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t know a single thing about you.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t even know your name.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is very uninspiring( 无聊的 ) writing to a thing.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am sure you throw my letters into the wastebasket( 废纸篓 ) without reading them.</p>
<p class="text-left">From now on I shall write only about work.</p>
<p class="text-left">My re-examinations in Latin( 拉丁语 ) and geometry( 几何学 ) were last week.</p>
<p class="text-left">I passed them both, and am now free from conditions.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">April 2nd</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">I am a BEAST( 野兽 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Please forget about that dreadful( 不光彩的 ) letter I sent you last week—I was feeling terribly lonely and miserable( 痛苦的 ) the night I wrote.</p>
<p class="text-left">My throat( 咽喉 ) hurt.</p>
<p class="text-left">I didn’t know it, but I was just sickening for tonsillitis( 扁桃体炎 ) and flu( 流感 ) and lots of things.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m in the infirmary( 医务室 ) now, and have been here for six days.</p>
<p class="text-left">This is the first time they have let me sit up and have a pen and paper.</p>
<p class="text-left">The head nurse is very bossy.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I’ve been thinking about it all the time, and I shan’t get well until you forgive( 原谅 ) me.</p>
<p class="text-left">Here is a picture of the way I look, with a bandage( 绷带 ) tied around my head in rabbit’s ears.</p>
<p class="text-left">Doesn’t that make you feel sorry for me?</p>
<p class="text-left">My sublingual glands( 舌下腺 ) are swollen( 肿胀的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">And I’ve been studying physiology( 生理学 ) all the year without ever having heard of them.</p>
<p class="text-left">How useless education is!</p>
<p class="text-left">I can’t write any more; I get rather shaky when I sit up too long.</p>
<p class="text-left">Please forgive( 原谅 ) me for being rude( 粗鲁的 ) and ungrateful( 不感激的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I was badly brought up.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours with love,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">THE INFIRMARY( 医务室 )</p>
<p class="text-left">April 4th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Yesterday evening just towards dark, I was sitting up in bed looking out at the rain and feeling awfully bored with life.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then the nurse appeared with a long white box addressed to me, and filled with the loveliest pink roses.</p>
<p class="text-left">And much nicer still, there was a card with a very polite message in it.</p>
<p class="text-left">The handwriting was rather unusual, but showed a great deal of character.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thank you, Daddy, a thousand times.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your flowers are the first real, true present I ever received in my life.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you want to know what a baby I am, I lay down and cried because I was so happy.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now that I am sure you read my letters, I’ll make them much more interesting.</p>
<p class="text-left">I hope they’ll be worth keeping in a safe with red tape around them.</p>
<p class="text-left">Only please take out that horrible( 糟糕的 ) one and burn it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’d hate to think that you ever read it again.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thank you for making a very sick, unhappy first-year student cheerful again.</p>
<p class="text-left">Probably you have lots of loving family and friends, and you don’t know what it feels like to be alone.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I do.</p>
<p class="text-left">Goodbye—I’ll promise never to be nasty again, because now I know you’re a real person; also I’ll promise never to bother( 麻烦 ) you with any more questions.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you still hate girls?</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours forever( 永远 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">Thursday evening</p>
<p class="text-left">What do you think is my favorite book?</p>
<p class="text-left">Just now, I mean; I change every three days.</p>
<p class="text-left">Wuthering Heights.</p>
<p class="text-left">Emily Bronte was quite young when she wrote it, and she had never been outside of the grounds of Haworth church.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had never known any men in her life; how could she imagine a man like Heathcliff?</p>
<p class="text-left">I couldn’t do it, and I’m quite young and only recently left the John Grier Home, so in some ways I’m quite like Emily Bronte.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sometimes I’m afraid that I’m not a genius( 天才 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Will you be very disappointed, Daddy, if I don’t turn out to be a great author?</p>
<p class="text-left">In the spring, when everything is so beautiful and green and growing, I feel like turning my back on lessons, and running away to play with the weather.</p>
<p class="text-left">There is so much fun to be had out in the fields!</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s much more interesting to live an adventurous( 惊险刺激的 ) life than to write about one.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ow!!!!!!</p>
<p class="text-left">That was a scream( 尖叫 ) which brought Sallie and Julia and the fourth-year student from across the hall.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was caused by a centipede( 蜈蚣 ) like this: only worse.</p>
<p class="text-left">Just as I had finished the last sentence and was thinking what to say next, it fell off the ceiling( 天花板 ) and landed at my side.</p>
<p class="text-left">I knocked two cups of tea off the table while trying to get away.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie hit it with the back of my hair brush—which I shall never be able to use again—and killed the front end, but the back fifty feet ran under the furniture( 家具 ) and escaped( 逃走 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">This part of the college, due to its age and ivy-covered walls, is full of centipedes.</p>
<p class="text-left">They are horrible. I’d rather find a tiger under the bed.</p></div>

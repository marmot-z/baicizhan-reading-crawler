                        <div><p class="text-left">While Heidi was talking, Peter’s mother arrived, and shouted out in her amazement( 惊讶地 ):</p>
<p class="text-left">“Surely, this is Heidi. But how can that be?”</p>
<p class="text-left">The child rose to shake hands with Brigida, who could not get over Heidi’s beautiful dress and hat.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You can have my hat, I don’t want it anymore; I have my old one still,” Heidi said, pulling out her old straw( 稻草 ) hat.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi had remembered her grandfather’s words to Deta about her feather( 羽毛 ) hat;</p>
<p class="text-left">that was why she had kept her old hat so carefully.</p>
<p class="text-left">Brigida at last accepted the gift after objecting a great many times.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly Heidi took off her pretty dress and tied her old scarf about her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Taking the grandmother’s hand, she said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Goodbye, I must go home to grandfather now, but I shall come again tomorrow. Good night, grandmother.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, please come again tomorrow, Heidi,” said the old woman, while she held her fast( 紧紧拉住 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">As Heidi climbed further up the mountain, she looked back and saw a scene so beautiful</p>
<p class="text-left">as she had not even seen anything like it in her most vivid( 生动的 ) dream.</p>
<p class="text-left">The rocky peaks( 山顶 ) were flaming( 火红的 ) in the bright light, the snow fields glowed( 发光 ) and soft clouds were floating( 漂浮 ) overhead( 在头上 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The child stood still, and in her joy( 欢乐 ) tears( 眼泪 ) ran down her cheeks( 脸颊 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Only when the glow had gone away was Heidi able to follow the path( 小路 ) again.</p>
<p class="text-left">She climbed so fast that she could soon discover, first the treetops( 树梢 ), then the roof( 屋顶 ), finally the hut( 小屋 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Now she could see her grandfather sitting on his bench( 长凳 ), smoking a pipe( 烟卷 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Above the cottage( 乡间小屋 ) the fir( 冷杉 ) trees gently swung( 摇摆 ) in the soft evening wind.</p>
<p class="text-left">At last she had reached the hut, and throwing herself in her grandfather’s arms, she hugged( 拥抱 ) him and held him tight( 紧紧地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">She could say nothing but “Grandfather! Grandfather! Grandfather!” in her excitement.</p>
<p class="text-left">The old man said nothing either, but his eyes were wet.</p>
<p class="text-left">Letting go of Heidi’s arms at last, he sat her on his knee.</p>
<p class="text-left">When he had looked at her for a while, he said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“So you have come home again, Heidi? Why? You certainly do not look very cityfied( 都市风的 )! Did they send you away?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh no, you must not think that, grandfather.</p>
<p class="text-left">They all were so good to me; Clara, Mr. Sesemann and grandmama( 祖母 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">But grandfather, sometimes I felt as if I could not bear it any longer to be away from you!</p>
<p class="text-left">I thought I could not breathe( 呼吸 );</p>
<p class="text-left">I could not tell anyone, for that would have been ungrateful( 忘恩负义的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly, one morning Mr. Sesemann called me very early, I think it was the doctor’s doing and—</p>
<p class="text-left">but I think it is probably written in this letter;”</p>
<p class="text-left">with that Heidi brought the letter and the bankroll( 钱 ) from her basket, putting them on her grandfather’s lap( 大腿 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“This belongs to( 属于 ) you,” he said, laying the roll beside him.</p>
<p class="text-left">Having read the letter, he put it in his pocket.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you think you can still drink milk with me, Heidi?” he asked, while he stepped into the cottage.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Take your money with you, you can buy a bed with it and clothes for many years.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t need it at all, grandfather,” Heidi assured( 使确信 ) him;</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have a bed and Clara has given me so many dresses that I shan’t need anymore all my life.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Take it and put it in the cupboard( 衣橱 ), for you will need it someday( 某天 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi obeyed( 听从 ), and danced around the hut in her delight( 高兴 ) to see all the things she had missed so much again.</p>
<p class="text-left">Running up to the loft( 阁楼 ), she exclaimed( 大声叫喊 ) in great disappointment( 失望 ):</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh grandfather, my bed is gone.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“It will come again,” the grandfather called up from below;</p>
<p class="text-left">“how could I know that you were coming back? Get your milk now!”</p>
<p class="text-left">When the grandfather came with the milk, Heidi took her old seat.</p>
<p class="text-left">She seized( 拿起 ) her bowl and emptied it eagerly( 急切地 ), as if it was the most wonderful thing she had ever tasted.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandfather, our milk is the best in all the world.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly Heidi, hearing a high whistle( 哨声 ), rushed outside, as Peter and all his goats( 山羊 ) came racing down.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi greeted( 问候 ) the boy, who stopped, rooted to the spot( 呆住不动 ), staring( 盯 ) at her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she ran into the middle of her friends, who had not forgotten her either.</p>
<p class="text-left">Schwänli and Bärli cried for joy, and all her other favorites pressed near to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was beside herself with joy, and touched little Snowhopper and Thistlefinch, till she felt herself pushed to and fro among them.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Peter, why don’t you come down and say good night to me?” Heidi called to the boy.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Have you come again?” he said at last.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he took Heidi’s hand and asked her, as if she had been always there:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are you coming up with me tomorrow?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No, tomorrow I must go to see grandmother, but perhaps the day after.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter had a hard time with his goats that night, for they would not follow him.</p>
<p class="text-left">Over and over again they came back to Heidi, till she entered the shed( 棚 ) with Bärli and Schwänli and shut the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Heidi went up to her loft to sleep, she found a fresh, fragrant( 芳香的 ) bed waiting for her;</p>
<p class="text-left">and she slept better that night than she had for many, many months, for her great and burning longing( 渴望 ) had been satisfied.</p>
<p class="text-left">About ten times that night the grandfather rose to listen to Heidi’s quiet breathing.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi slept quietly, for she had seen the flaming mountains and had heard the fir trees roar( 咆哮 ).</p></div>

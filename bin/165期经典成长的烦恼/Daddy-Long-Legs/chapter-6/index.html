                        <div><p class="text-left">It’s a fine thing to be educated—but nothing compared to the experience of owning six new dresses.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Pritchard, who is on the visiting committee( 委员会 ), picked them out—not Mrs. Lippett, thank goodness.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have an evening dress of pink silk (I’m perfectly beautiful in that), and a blue church dress, and a red dinner dress with Oriental( 东方风情的 ) trim( 剪裁 ) (which makes me look like a Gipsy).</p>
<p class="text-left">And I have another of rose-colored lace( 蕾丝 ), and a gray street suit( 套装 ), and an everyday dress for classes.</p>
<p class="text-left">That wouldn’t be a very big collection of clothes for Julia Rutledge Pendleton, perhaps, but for Jerusha Abbott—Oh, my!</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy, aren’t you glad you’re not a girl?</p>
<p class="text-left">I suppose you think that the fuss( 无谓的激动 ) we make over clothes is very silly?</p>
<p class="text-left">It is. No doubt about it. But it’s entirely your fault( 错误 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I suppose you’re thinking now what a silly, shallow( 肤浅的 ) little beast( 野兽 ) I am, and what a waste of money it is to educate a girl?</p>
<p class="text-left">But, Daddy, if you’d been dressed in checked cotton( 棉质的 ) dresses all your life, you’d understand how I feel.</p>
<p class="text-left">And when I started going to the high school, that was an even worse time.</p>
<p class="text-left">My dresses came from the poor box.</p>
<p class="text-left">You can’t know how I hated appearing in school in those horrible( 可怕的 ) poor-box dresses.</p>
<p class="text-left">I would always be placed next to the girl who first owned my dress.</p>
<p class="text-left">She would whisper( 窃窃私语 ) to the others.</p>
<p class="text-left">The bitterness( 怨恨 ) of wearing your enemies’ old clothes eats away at you.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I wore silk stockings( 长袜 ) for the rest of my life, I don’t believe it ever heals( 愈合 ) the hurt I still feel.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="text-left">J. Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S. I know I’m not to expect any letters in return, and I’ve been warned not to bother( 烦扰 ) you with questions, but tell me, Daddy, just this once—are you awfully old or just a little old?</p>
<p class="text-left">And are you bald( 秃头的 )?</p>
<p class="text-left">Since I don’t really know anything about you, I have to think about you like a problem in mathematics( 数学 ): given a tall rich man who hates girls, but is very generous( 慷慨的 ) to one girl, what does he look like?</p>
<p class="text-left">Please, tell me!</p>
<p class="text-left">December 19th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">You never answered my question and it was very important.</p>
<p class="text-left">ARE YOU BALD?</p>
<p class="text-left">I have it planned exactly what you look like—very satisfactorily—until I reach the top of your head, and then I am stuck.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can’t decide whether you have white hair or black hair, or maybe none at all.</p>
<p class="text-left">Here is your picture:</p>
<p class="text-left">But the problem is, shall I add some hair?</p>
<p class="text-left">Would you like to know what color your eyes are?</p>
<p class="text-left">They’re gray, and you have very big eyebrows( 眉毛 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Your mouth is a straight line that turns down at the corners.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, you see, I know!</p>
<p class="text-left">You’re a grumpy( 脾气坏的 ) old man.</p>
<p class="text-left">(The bell has rung, so I must go.)</p>
<p class="text-left">9.45 p.m.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have a new rule that I will always keep.</p>
<p class="text-left">I will never, never study at night, no matter how many tests I have in the morning.</p>
<p class="text-left">Instead, I read just ordinary books.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have to, because there are eighteen empty years behind me.</p>
<p class="text-left">You wouldn’t believe, Daddy, how deep the ignorance( 无知 ) of my mind is; I am only just finding out myself.</p>
<p class="text-left">Most girls with a normal family and a home and friends and a library learn things naturally.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t.</p>
<p class="text-left">For example:</p>
<p class="text-left">I never read Cinderella or Robinson Crusoe or Jane Eyre or Alice in Wonderland or a word of Rudyard Kipling.</p>
<p class="text-left">I didn’t know that people used to be monkeys and that the Garden of Eden was a beautiful myth( 神话 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I didn’t know that R. L. S. stood for Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>
<p class="text-left">I had never seen a picture of the “Mona Lisa” and (It’s true but you won’t believe it.)</p>
<p class="text-left">I had never heard of Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now, I know all of these things and a lot of others as well, but you can see how much I need to catch up.</p>
<p class="text-left">And it’s such fun!</p>
<p class="text-left">I look forward all day to the evening, and then I put a “Do not disturb( 请勿打扰 )” sign on the door and light the lamp( 灯 ), and read and read and read.</p>
<p class="text-left">One book isn’t enough. I have four going at once.</p>
<p class="text-left">Just now, they’re Tennyson’s poems and Thackeray’s “Vanity Fair( 名利场 )” and Kipling’s “Plain Tales from the Hills( 山中故事 )” and—don’t laugh—Louisa Alcott’s “Little Women.”</p>
<p class="text-left">I find that I am the only girl in college who wasn’t brought up on “Little Women.”</p>
<p class="text-left">I haven’t told anybody though.</p>
<p class="text-left">(That would make everyone think I was a strange girl.)</p>
<p class="text-left">I just quietly went and bought it with $1.12 of my last month’s allowance( 零用钱 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">(Ten o’clock bell. This is a very interrupted( 被打断的 ) letter.)</p>
<p class="text-left">Sunday</p>
<p class="text-left">The Christmas holidays begin next week and everyone has already packed( 打包 ) away the things they won’t need at home.</p>
<p class="text-left">The corridors( 走廊 ) are so filled up that you can hardly get through.</p>
<p class="text-left">Everybody is so full of excitement that studying is taking second place.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m going to have a beautiful time over the holidays.</p>
<p class="text-left">There’s another first-year who lives in Texas staying behind, and we are planning to take long walks.</p>
<p class="text-left">If there’s any ice, we’ll learn to skate.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then there is still the whole library to be read—and three empty weeks to do it in!</p>
<p class="text-left">Goodbye, Daddy, I hope that you are feeling as happy as I am.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S. Don’t forget to answer my question.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you don’t want the trouble of writing, have your secretary send a letter.</p>
<p class="text-left">He can just say:</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Smith is quite bald,</p>
<p class="text-left">or</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Smith is not bald,</p>
<p class="text-left">or</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Smith has white hair.</p>
<p class="text-left">And you can take the cost of the stamp out of my allowance.</p>
<p class="text-left">Goodbye till January—and a merry Christmas( 圣诞快乐 )!</p></div>

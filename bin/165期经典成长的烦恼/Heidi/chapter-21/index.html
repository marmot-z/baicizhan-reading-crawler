                        <div><p class="text-left">Heidi was standing under the swaying( 摇摆的 ) fir( 冷杉 ) trees, waiting for her grandfather to join her.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had promised to bring up her trunk( 旅行箱 ) from the village while she went to visit the grandmother.</p>
<p class="text-left">The child was longing to see the blind woman again and to hear how she had liked the rolls( 面包卷 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">When they had went down and Heidi entered Peter’s hut( 小屋 ), the grandmother called lovingly to her:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Have you come again, child?”</p>
<p class="text-left">She took hold of Heidi’s hand and held it tight( 紧紧地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandmother then told the little visitor how good the rolls had tasted, and how much stronger she felt already.</p>
<p class="text-left">Brigida related further that the grandmother had only eaten a single roll, being so afraid to finish them too soon.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi had listened with great attention, and said now:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, grandmother, I have an awful lot of money. Now I know what I’ll do with it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Every day you must have a fresh roll and two on Sundays.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter can bring them up from the village.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No, no, child,” the grandmother said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That must not be. You must give it to grandfather and he’ll tell you what to do with it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">But Heidi did not listen.</p>
<p class="text-left">She jumped happily about the little room, calling over and over again,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Maybe your eyes will see again, too, when you are strong and well.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmother remained silent, not to spoil( 破坏 ) the child’s happiness.</p>
<p class="text-left">Seeing the old song book on the shelf( 架子 ), Heidi said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandmother, shall I read you a song from your book now? I can read quite nicely!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh yes, I wish you would, child. Can you really read?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi climbed on a chair and took down the dusty( 沾满灰尘的 ) old book.</p>
<p class="text-left">After she had carefully cleaned it, she sat down on a chair.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What shall I read, grandmother?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Whatever you want to,” was the reply.</p>
<p class="text-left">Turning the pages, Heidi found a song about the sun, and decided to read that aloud.</p>
<p class="text-left">An expression of indescribable happiness shone in the grandmother’s face, though tears( 眼泪 ) were rolling( 滚 ) down her cheeks( 脸颊 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">When Heidi had repeated the end of the song a number of times, the old woman shouted out:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Heidi, everything seems bright to me again and my heart is light.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thank you, child, you have done me so much good.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Soon the grandfather knocked on the window, for it was time to go.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi told the grandfather she planned to buy rolls for the grandmother every day, and he agreed.</p>
<p class="text-left">At this the child jumped, shouting:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh grandfather, now grandmother won’t ever have to eat hard, black bread anymore.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, everything is so wonderful now!</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandmama told me that God would make everything much better than I could ever dream.</p>
<p class="text-left">We’ll pray( 祈祷 ) every day, grandfather, won’t we? Otherwise, God might forget us.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“And if somebody should forget to do it?” murmured( 咕哝 ) the old man.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, he’ll get on badly, for God will forget him, too.”</p>
<p class="text-left">After a pause( 停顿 ) the grandfather said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, but if it has happened, then there is no help; nobody can come back to the Lord, when God has once forgotten him.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But grandfather, everybody can come back to Him; grandmama( 祖母 ) told me that.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you know the story of the prodigal( 浪子回头的 ) son? I shall tell you as soon as we get home.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When they arrived at the hut, Heidi began to tell the famous story to the grandfather, who sat silently beside her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Isn’t it a beautiful story, grandfather?” asked Heidi when she finished.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, Heidi, it is,” said the grandfather.</p>
<p class="text-left">A few hours later, when Heidi was sleeping soundly( 酣睡地 ), the old man climbed up the ladder( 阶梯 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Placing a little lamp( 灯 ) beside the sleeping child, he watched her a long, long time.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her little hands were folded( 交叠 ) and her red face looked confident( 自信的 ) and peaceful.</p>
<p class="text-left">The old man now folded his hands. Big tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>
<p class="text-left">He said in a low voice:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Father, I have done wrong against Heaven( 天堂 ) and You, and am no more worthy to be Your son!”</p>
<p class="text-left">The next morning found the uncle standing before the door, looking over valley( 山谷 ) and mountain.</p>
<p class="text-left">A few early bells sounded from below and the birds sang their morning songs.</p>
<p class="text-left">Entering the house again, he called:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Heidi, get up! The sun is shining! Put on a pretty dress, for we are going to church!”</p>
<p class="text-left">That was a new call, and Heidi obeyed( 听从 ) quickly.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the child came downstairs( 下楼 ) in her smart( 漂亮的 ) little dress, she opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, grandfather!” she shouted,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have never seen you in your Sunday coat with the silver buttons( 纽扣 ). Oh, how fine you look!”</p>
<p class="text-left">The old man, turning to the child, said with a smile,</p>
<p class="text-left">“You look nice, too; come now!”</p>
<p class="text-left">When they entered the church, all the people were singing.</p>
<p class="text-left">Though they sat down on the last bench( 长凳 ) behind, the people had noticed their presence and whispered( 低声说 ) it from ear to ear.</p>
<p class="text-left">After the service the old man and the child walked together to the churchman’s home.</p>
<p class="text-left">He opened the door and received them with friendly words.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have come to ask you to forgive( 原谅 ) me for my harsh( 难听的 ) words,” said the uncle.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I want to follow your advice to spend the winter here among you.</p>
<p class="text-left">If the people look at me and they don’t trust me, I can’t expect any better.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am sure you will trust me.”</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">Miss Minchin was out of breath between anger and climbing the stairs.</p>
<p class="text-left">The meat pie had been saved for her special late supper.</p>
<p class="text-left">It became clear that she boxed Becky’s ears.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Don’t tell lies,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Go to your room this instant.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Both Sara and Ermengarde heard the sound of the hit, and then heard Becky run up the stairs and into her attic.</p>
<p class="text-left">They heard her door shut, and knew that she threw herself upon her bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I could have eaten two of them,” they heard her cry into her pillow.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But I never took a bite. It was cook who gave it to her policeman.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara stood in the middle of the room in the darkness.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was pressing her little teeth together and opening and closing her hands angrily.</p>
<p class="text-left">She could hardly stand still, but she did not move until Miss Minchin had gone down the stairs and all was still.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The awful, cruel thing!” Sara cried out.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The cook takes things herself and then says Becky steals them.</p>
<p class="text-left">She doesn’t! She doesn’t!”</p>
<p class="text-left">She pressed her hands hard against her face and burst into tears, and Ermengarde, hearing this unusual thing, was surprised by it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara was crying!</p>
<p class="text-left">The unbeatable Sara!</p>
<p class="text-left">It seemed to show something new—some state she had never known.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suppose—suppose—a new terrible possibility presented itself to Ermengarde’s kind, little mind all at once.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Sara,” she said in a shy, almost frightened voice, “I don’t want to be rude, but—are you ever hungry?”</p>
<p class="text-left">It was too much just at that moment.</p>
<p class="text-left">The wall broke down.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara lifted her face from her hands.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” she said in a new way, full of feeling.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, I am. And it makes it worse to hear poor Becky. She’s hungrier than I am.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, oh!” Ermengarde cried sadly. “And I never knew!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I didn’t want you to know,” Sara said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It would have made me feel like a street beggar. I know I look like a street beggar.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No, you don’t—you don’t!” Ermengarde broke in.</p>
<p class="text-left">“A little boy once gave me a sixpence for charity( 慈善 ),” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He wouldn’t have given me his Christmas sixpence if I hadn’t looked as if I needed it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Who was he?” asked Ermengarde.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He was a dear little thing going to a party,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He was one of the Large Family, the little one with the round legs.</p>
<p class="text-left">I suppose his nursery was full of Christmas presents and baskets full of cakes and things, and he could see I had nothing.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde gave a little jump back.</p>
<p class="text-left">The last sentences had suddenly reminded her of something.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Sara!” she cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What a silly thing I am not to have thought of it!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Of what?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Something wonderful!” said Ermengarde, in an excited hurry.</p>
<p class="text-left">“This very afternoon my nicest aunt sent me a box.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is full of good things.</p>
<p class="text-left">I never touched it, I had so much dessert at dinner.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She began to speak very quickly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s got cake in it, and little meat pies, and jam tarts( 馅饼 ) and buns, and oranges, and figs( 无花果 ) and chocolate.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ll go back to my room and get it this minute, and we’ll eat it now.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara almost fell over.</p>
<p class="text-left">When one is weak with hunger, the mention of food has sometimes a strange effect.</p>
<p class="text-left">She touched Ermengarde’s arm.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you think—you could?” she asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I know I could,” answered Ermengarde, and she ran to the door—opened it softly—put her head out into the darkness, and listened.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she went back to Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The lights are out.</p>
<p class="text-left">Everybody’s in bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can move quietly and slowly, and no one will hear.”</p>
<p class="text-left">It was so delightful that they caught each other’s hands and a sudden light sprang into Sara’s eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Ermie!” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Let us pretend! Let us pretend it’s a party!</p>
<p class="text-left">And oh, won’t you invite the prisoner in the next cell?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes! Yes! Let us knock on the wall now. The jailer won’t hear.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara went to the wall.</p>
<p class="text-left">Through it she could hear poor Becky crying more softly.</p>
<p class="text-left">She knocked four times.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That means, ‘Come to me through the secret passage under the wall,’ she explained.</p>
<p class="text-left">‘I have something to communicate.’ ”</p>
<p class="text-left">Five quick knocks answered her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is coming,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">Almost immediately the door of the attic opened and Becky appeared.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her eyes were red and her cap was falling off.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she caught sight of Ermengarde, she began to wipe her face nervously with her skirt.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Don’t mind me a bit, Becky!” cried Ermengarde.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Miss Ermengarde has asked you to come in,” said Sara, “because she is going to bring a box of good things up here to us.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky’s cap almost fell off entirely, she broke in with such excitement.</p>
<p class="text-left">“To eat, miss?” she said. “Things that’s good to eat?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” answered Sara, “and we are going to pretend a party.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“And you shall have as much as you want to eat,” put in Ermengarde.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’ll go this minute!”</p>
<p class="text-left">She was in such a hurry that as she carefully left the attic, she dropped her red shawl( 披肩 ) and did not know it had fallen.</p>
<p class="text-left">No one saw it for a minute or so.</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky could not believe the good luck which had come into her life.</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">The whole house is being cleaned and all the curtains( 窗帘 ) washed.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am driving to the Corners this morning to get two cans of brown floor paint.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Dowd is coming tomorrow to wash the windows. (We need help, so we are forgetting about the missing pig for now.)</p>
<p class="text-left">You might think, from all this, that the house was not already perfectly clean.</p>
<p class="text-left">But it was!</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Semple may not know everything, but she knows how to keep a house clean.</p>
<p class="text-left">Daddy, that’s just like a man!</p>
<p class="text-left">He gives us no idea whether he will arrive today, or in two weeks.</p>
<p class="text-left">We shall never be able to relax until he comes.</p>
<p class="text-left">And if he doesn’t hurry, the cleaning may all have to be done over again.</p>
<p class="text-left">With my hand on my heart—farewell( 再见 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">PS. Isn’t that a nice ending?</p>
<p class="text-left">I got it out of Stevenson’s letters.</p>
<p class="text-left">Saturday</p>
<p class="text-left">Good morning again!</p>
<p class="text-left">I didn’t finish this before the postman came, so I’ll add some more.</p>
<p class="text-left">We have one mail delivery( 送信 ) a day at twelve o’clock.</p>
<p class="text-left">No sign yet of Master( 老爷 ) Jervie.</p>
<p class="text-left">But you should see how clean our house is—and how carefully we wipe( 擦拭 ) our feet before we step in!</p>
<p class="text-left">I hope he’ll come soon; I need someone to talk to.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Semple’s world is just this single farm.</p>
<p class="text-left">People here don’t care about the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s exactly the same as the orphans( 孤儿 ) at the John Grier Home.</p>
<p class="text-left">Our ideas were limited( 限制 ) by the four sides of the iron fence( 栅栏 ) around us.</p>
<p class="text-left">I didn’t mind it so much then because I was younger, and very busy.</p>
<p class="text-left">After I’d got all my beds made and my babies’ faces washed, and had gone to school and come home and had washed their faces again, and learned my lessons in between—I was ready to go to bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">I didn’t notice any lack of intelligent( 机智的 ) conversation.</p>
<p class="text-left">But after two years in a conversational college, I do miss it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I shall be glad to see somebody who speaks my language.</p>
<p class="text-left">I really believe I’ve finished, Daddy.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can’t think of anything else at the moment—I’ll try to write a longer letter next time.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours always,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">PS. The lettuce( 生菜 ) hasn’t done at all well this year.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was so dry early in the season.</p>
<p class="text-left">August 25th</p>
<p class="text-left">Well, Daddy, Master Jervie’s here.</p>
<p class="text-left">And we’re having such a nice time!!</p>
<p class="text-left">At least I am, and I think he is, too—he has been here for ten days and he doesn’t show any signs of going.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Semple is really too good to him.</p>
<p class="text-left">If she spoiled( 溺爱 ) him like this when he was a child, I don’t know how he ever turned out so well.</p>
<p class="text-left">He and I eat at a little table under the trees, or—when it rains or is cold—in the sitting room.</p>
<p class="text-left">He just decides where he wants to eat, and Carrie runs after him with the table.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then, if she has had to carry the dishes very far, she finds a dollar under the sugar bowl.</p>
<p class="text-left">He is a very friendly sort of man, though you might not realize it if you didn’t know him.</p>
<p class="text-left">He looks at first sight like a true Pendleton, but he isn’t in the least.</p>
<p class="text-left">He is just as simple and natural and sweet as he can be.</p>
<p class="text-left">That seems a funny way to describe a man, but it’s true.</p>
<p class="text-left">He’s very good with the farmers around here.</p>
<p class="text-left">He meets them in a sort of man-to-man( 坦诚的 ) way.</p>
<p class="text-left">They were very suspicious( 多疑的 ) at first.</p>
<p class="text-left">They judged( 评判 ) him by his clothes, which are rather more city than country.</p>
<p class="text-left">Whenever he wears something new, Mrs. Semple first admires( 称赞 ) it, then tells him to be careful not to get it dirty.</p>
<p class="text-left">And he always says to her:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Run along, Lizzie, and do your work.</p>
<p class="text-left">You can’t tell me what to do any longer. I’ve grown up.”</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s funny to think of that great big, long-legged man (nearly as long-legged as you, Daddy) ever sitting in Mrs. Semple’s lap( 大腿 ) and having his face washed.</p>
<p class="text-left">We’re having such fun!</p>
<p class="text-left">We’ve explored( 探究 ) the country for miles, and I’ve learned to fish with “flies” made of feathers( 羽毛 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Also to shoot with a gun.</p>
<p class="text-left">Also to ride a horse—there’s still some life in old Grove.</p>
<p class="text-left">We fed( 喂 ) him on oats( 燕麦 ) for three days, and he almost ran away with me.</p>
<p class="text-left">Wednesday</p>
<p class="text-left">We climbed Sky Hill on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p class="text-left">That’s a mountain near here.</p>
<p class="text-left">Not a very high mountain, perhaps—no snow—but at least you are out of breath( 上气不接下气 ) when you reach the top.</p>
<p class="text-left">The lower slopes( 山坡 ) are covered with woods, but the top is just rocks.</p>
<p class="text-left">We stayed up for the sunset( 日落 ) and built a fire and cooked our dinner.</p>
<p class="text-left">Master Jervie did the cooking.</p>
<p class="text-left">He said he knew how to cook outdoors better than me, and he did, too, because he’s used to camping.</p>
<p class="text-left">We came down by moonlight, and then when we reached the wood, it was too dark to see, so Jervie pulled a flashlight( 手电筒 ) out of his pocket.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was such fun!</p>
<p class="text-left">He laughed and joked all the way, and talked about interesting things.</p>
<p class="text-left">He’s read all the books I’ve ever read, and a lot of others besides.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s amazing( 惊人的 ) how many different things he knows.</p>
<p class="text-left">We went for a long walk this morning, and got caught in a storm.</p>
<p class="text-left">Our clothes were wet through before we reached home, but our spirits were not even damp( 潮湿的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">You should have seen Mrs. Semple’s face when we dripped( 身上滴水 ) into her kitchen.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Master Jervie—Miss Judy! You are wet through. Dear! Dear! What shall I do? That nice new coat is perfectly ruined( 被毁掉了 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">She was so funny.</p>
<p class="text-left">You would have thought that we were ten years old, and she was our mother.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was afraid for a while that we weren’t going to get any jam( 果酱 ) for tea.</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">MAGNOLIA,</p>
<p class="text-left">Four days later</p>
<p class="text-left">I’d just finished writing the words above, when—what do you think happened?</p>
<p class="text-left">Master( 老爷 ) Jervie is going abroad( 出国 ) too this summer.</p>
<p class="text-left">Not with Julia and her family, but entirely by himself. I told him that you had invited me to go with a lady who is chaperoning( 陪伴 ) a party of girls.</p>
<p class="text-left">He knows about you, Daddy.</p>
<p class="text-left">That is, he knows that my father and mother are dead, and that a kind gentleman is sending me to college.</p>
<p class="text-left">I didn’t have the courage to tell him about the John Grier Home and all the rest.</p>
<p class="text-left">He thinks that you are my guardian( 监护人 ) and an old family friend.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have never told him that I didn’t know you—that would seem too strange!</p>
<p class="text-left">Anyway, he insisted( 坚持 ) on my going to Europe.</p>
<p class="text-left">He said that it was a necessary part of my education and that I mustn’t think of refusing.</p>
<p class="text-left">Also, he said that he would be in Paris( 巴黎，地名 ) at the same time, and we would run away from the chaperone occasionally and have dinner together at nice, funny, foreign restaurants.</p>
<p class="text-left">Well, Daddy, it did appeal( 有吸引力 ) to me!</p>
<p class="text-left">I almost weakened. If he hadn’t been so bossy( 专横的 ), maybe I should have entirely weakened.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can be led on step by step, but I won’t be forced.</p>
<p class="text-left">He said I was a silly, foolish( 愚蠢的 ), stubborn( 固执的 ) child. (Those are a few of his insults( 辱骂 ); I have forgotten the rest.)</p>
<p class="text-left">He said that I didn’t know what was good for me, and I ought to let older people decide.</p>
<p class="text-left">We almost quarreled( 吵架 )—in fact, I think we did!</p>
<p class="text-left">So you see, Daddy, I am trying to avoid temptation( 诱惑 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t be angry with me, please, and don’t think that I do not appreciate( 感激 ) your kindness.</p>
<p class="text-left">I do—always. The only way I can ever pay you back is by turning out a Very Useful Citizen. (Are women citizens? I don’t suppose they are.)</p>
<p class="text-left">Anyway, a Very Useful Person.</p>
<p class="text-left">And when you look at me you can say, “I gave that Very Useful Person to the world.”</p>
<p class="text-left">That sounds good, doesn’t it, Daddy?</p>
<p class="text-left">But I don’t wish to mislead you.</p>
<p class="text-left">The feeling often comes over me that I am not at all special.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is fun to plan a career( 事业 ), but I probably shan’t turn out a bit different from any other ordinary person.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">August 19th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">A letter comes from Mr. Jervis Pendleton in Paris.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s rather a short letter.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m not quite forgiven( 被原谅 ) yet for refusing to follow his advice.</p>
<p class="text-left">However, if he gets back in time, he will see me for a few days at Lock Willow( 柳树 ) before college opens.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I am very nice and sweet and do as he says, I shall (he implies( 暗示 )) be received into favor again.</p>
<p class="text-left">Also a letter from Sallie.</p>
<p class="text-left">She wants me to come to their camp for two weeks in September.</p>
<p class="text-left">Must I ask your permission( 允许 ), or may I now do as I please?</p>
<p class="text-left">Yes, I’m sure I may—I’m a fourth-year now, you know.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve worked all summer, and I deserve a little fun.</p>
<p class="text-left">I want to see the Adirondacks; I want to see Sallie.</p>
<p class="text-left">I want to see Sallie’s brother—he’s going to teach me to canoe( 划艇 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">But my main reason is a nasty( 不好的 ) one.</p>
<p class="text-left">I want Master Jervie to arrive at Lock Willow, and find me not there.</p>
<p class="text-left">I must show him that he can’t order me around.</p>
<p class="text-left">No one can give me orders but you, Daddy—and even you can’t always!</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m off for the woods.</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">CAMP MCBRIDE,</p>
<p class="text-left">September 6th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy,</p>
<p class="text-left">Your letter didn’t come in time (I am pleased to say).</p>
<p class="text-left">If you want me to obey( 遵守 ) your instructions, you must have your secretary send them in less than two weeks.</p>
<p class="text-left">As you see, I am here, and have been for five days.</p>
<p class="text-left">The woods are fine, and so is the camp, and so is the weather, and so are the McBrides, and so is the whole world.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m very happy!</p>
<p class="text-left">There’s Jimmie calling for me to come canoeing.</p>
<p class="text-left">Goodbye—sorry to have disobeyed( 违背 ) you, but why are you so determined( 坚定的 ) not to allow me to play a little?</p>
<p class="text-left">When I’ve worked all the summer I deserve( 值得 ) two weeks.</p>
<p class="text-left">You are being a real dog in the manger( 自己不享用又不让别人享用的人 ) about this.</p>
<p class="text-left">However—I love you still, Daddy, even with all your faults( 错误 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">October 3rd</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Back at college and a fourth-year!</p>
<p class="text-left">Also editor( 编辑 ) of the Monthly.</p>
<p class="text-left">It doesn’t seem possible, does it, that so cultured a person was an orphan( 孤儿 ) in the John Grier Home just four years ago?</p>
<p class="text-left">We progress fast in America!</p>
<p class="text-left">What do you think of this?</p>
<p class="text-left">A note from Master Jervie sent to Lock Willow and forwarded here.</p>
<p class="text-left">He’s sorry, but he finds that he can’t get up there this autumn; he has accepted an invitation to go yachting( 划艇 ) with some friends.</p>
<p class="text-left">He hopes I’ve had a nice summer and am enjoying the country.</p>
<p class="text-left">And he knew all the time that I was with the McBrides, for Julia told him so!</p>
<p class="text-left">You men ought to leave these kinds of tricks( 招数 ) to women; you don’t have enough experience with them.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">November 17th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">My career as a writer is not progressing as fast as I had hoped.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t know whether to tell you or not, but I would like some (silent) sympathy( 安慰 ), please.</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t reopen( 重新揭开 ) the wound by mentioning it in your next letter.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve been writing a book, all last winter in the evenings and all the summer.</p>
<p class="text-left">I just finished it before college started, and sent it to a publisher( 出版商 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He kept it two months, and I was certain he was going to take it.</p>
<p class="text-left">But yesterday morning it came back, with a letter from the publisher.</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">To her surprise, a small light came into the child’s eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Can I work?” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If I can work it will not matter so much. What can I do?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You can do anything you are told,” was the answer.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If you make yourself useful I may let you stay here.</p>
<p class="text-left">You speak French well, and you can help with the younger children.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“May I?” asked Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, please let me! I know I can teach them.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You will have to do more than teach the little ones,” replied Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You will run errands( 跑腿 ) and help in the kitchen as well as in the classroom.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you don’t please me, you will be sent away.</p>
<p class="text-left">Remember that.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now go.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara stood still just a moment, looking at her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she turned to leave the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Stop!” said Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Don’t you wish to thank me?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara paused, and all the deep, strange thoughts came to her mind.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What for?” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“For my kindness to you,” replied Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“For my kindness in giving you a home.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara made two or three steps toward her, and she spoke in an un-childishly fierce way.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You are not kind,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You are not kind, and it is not a home.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And she had turned and run out of the room before Miss Minchin could do anything but stare after her with stony( 冷酷的 ) anger.</p>
<p class="text-left">She went up the stairs slowly, holding Emily tightly against her side.</p>
<p class="text-left">She meant to go to her room.</p>
<p class="text-left">Just before she reached the landing, however, Miss Amelia came out of the door and closed it behind her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She stood before it, looking nervous and awkward.</p>
<p class="text-left">The truth was that she felt secretly ashamed of the thing she had been ordered to do.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You—you are not to go in there,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Not go in?” asked Sara with surprise.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That is not your room now,” Miss Amelia answered, reddening a little.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara realized that this was the change Miss Minchin had spoken of.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Where is my room?” she asked, hoping that her voice did not shake.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You are to sleep in the attic next to Becky.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara knew where it was.</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky had told her about it.</p>
<p class="text-left">She turned, and went up two flights( 阶梯 ) of stairs.</p>
<p class="text-left">She felt as if she were leaving far behind her the world in which she had lived.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she reached the attic door and opened it, her heart gave a sad little beat.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she shut the door and looked about her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yes, this was another world.</p>
<p class="text-left">The room had a low white roof.</p>
<p class="text-left">There was an unused fireplace, and a hard iron bed covered with an old blanket( 毯子 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Under the window in the roof, which showed nothing but a small piece of dull( 阴沉的 ) gray sky, there stood an old broken red footstool( 脚凳 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara went to it and sat down.</p>
<p class="text-left">She seldom cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not cry now.</p>
<p class="text-left">She laid Emily across her knees and put her face down upon her and her arms around her, and sat there.</p>
<p class="text-left">As she sat in this silence there came a low knock at the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was shyly pushed open and Becky’s tearful( 泪流满面的 ) face appeared round it.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, miss,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Might I—would you allow me—to come in?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara looked at her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She tried to smile, and somehow she could not.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Becky,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I told you we were just the same—just two little girls.</p>
<p class="text-left">You see how true it is.</p>
<p class="text-left">There’s no difference now.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m not a princess anymore.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky ran to her and caught her hand, sitting beside her and crying with love and pain.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, miss, you are,” she cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Whatever happens to you, you are a princess all the same—and nothing could make you anything different.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The first night she spent in her attic was a thing Sara never forgot.</p>
<p class="text-left">“My papa is dead!” she kept whispering to herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">“My papa is dead!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Her bed was so hard that she turned over and over in it to find a place to rest.</p>
<p class="text-left">The darkness was greater than any she had ever known.</p>
<p class="text-left">The wind made a terrible sound over the roof among the chimneys.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then there was something worse.</p>
<p class="text-left">This was certain sounds coming from the walls.</p>
<p class="text-left">She knew what they meant, because Becky had described them.</p>
<p class="text-left">They meant rats and mice.</p>
<p class="text-left">Once or twice she even heard the sound of feet moving across the floor.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she heard them, she started up in bed and sat shaking.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she lay down again, she covered her head with the blanket.</p>
<p class="text-left">The change in her life did not come about slowly, but was made all at once.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She must be taught what she is to expect at once,” Miss Minchin said to Miss Amelia.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mariette had left the house the next morning.</p>
<p class="text-left">The sight Sara caught of her sitting room, as she passed its open door, showed her that everything had been changed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her expensive things had been removed, and it was a new pupil’s bedroom now.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she went down to breakfast she saw that her seat at Miss Minchin’s side was taken by Lavinia.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin spoke to her coldly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You will begin your new duties, Sara,” she said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“by taking your seat with the younger children.</p>
<p class="text-left">You must keep them quiet, and see that they behave well.”</p></div>

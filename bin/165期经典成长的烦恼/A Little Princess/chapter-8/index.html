                        <div><p class="text-left">When Sara entered the room, Lottie was lying upon the floor, screaming and kicking.</p>
<p class="text-left">Lottie had always found, when in her own nursery at home, that the adults would do anything to make her stop kicking and screaming.</p>
<p class="text-left">Poor Miss Amelia was trying first one method, and then another.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Poor darling,” she said one moment.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I know you don’t have any mamma, poor—” Then in quite another manner, she would say,</p>
<p class="text-left">“If you don’t stop, Lottie, I will shake you. Poor little angel( 天使 )!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara went to them quietly.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not know at all what she was going to do, but she felt that it would be better not to say such different things quite so helplessly( 无可奈何地 ) and excitedly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Miss Amelia,” she said in a low voice, “Miss Minchin says I may try to make her stop—may I?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Amelia turned and looked at her hopelessly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, do you think you can?” she asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t know whether I can”, answered Sara, still in her half whisper, “but I will try. If you will steal out of the room, I will stay with her.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Amelia went quietly out of the room, and was very much relieved to find an excuse for doing so.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara stood by the crying child for a few moments, and looked down at her without saying anything.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she sat down flat on the floor beside her and waited. Except for Lottie’s angry screams, the room was quite quiet.</p>
<p class="text-left">This was a new experience for little Miss Legh, who was used to hearing other people try to stop her when she screamed.</p>
<p class="text-left">To kick and cry, and find the only person near you not seeming to mind, got Lottie’s attention.</p>
<p class="text-left">She opened her tight shut streaming eyes to see who this person was.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was the little girl who owned Emily and all the nice things.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had stopped for a few seconds to find this out, so Lottie thought she must begin again.</p>
<p class="text-left">The quiet of the room and of Sara’s interested face, however, made her first cry out rather half-hearted( 半心半意的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“I—don’t have—any—ma—ma—ma-a!” Lottie said.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara looked at her with a sort of understanding in her eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Neither do I,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">This was so unexpected that Lottie actually dropped her legs, and stared.</p>
<p class="text-left">A new idea will stop a crying child when nothing else will.</p>
<p class="text-left">Also it was true that while Lottie disliked Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia, she rather liked Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">After another sad cry, she said, “Where is she?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“She went to heaven,” Sara said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But I am sure she comes out sometimes to see me—though I don’t see her. So does yours.</p>
<p class="text-left">Perhaps they can both see us now. Perhaps they are both in this room.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Lottie sat up quickly, and looked about her.</p>
<p class="text-left">If her mamma had seen her during the last half hour, she might not have thought her the kind of child who ought to be related to an angel.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara went on talking.</p>
<p class="text-left">Perhaps some people might think that what she said was like a fairy( 虚构的 ) story, but it was so real that Lottie began to listen despite her sadness.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There are fields and fields of flowers,” she said, talking rather as if she were in a dream.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And when the soft wind blows over them, it carries the smell of them into the air.</p>
<p class="text-left">Everybody always breathes it, because the soft wind is always blowing.</p>
<p class="text-left">And little children run about in the fields and pick the flowers, and laugh and make little wreaths( 花冠 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">And the streets are shining.</p>
<p class="text-left">And people are never tired, however far they walk.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Lottie stopped crying, listening with interest.</p>
<p class="text-left">She moved closer to Sara, and drank in every word until Sara finished.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I want to go there,” Lottie cried again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I—don’t have any mamma in this school.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara took hold of Lottie’s hand and pulled her close to her side.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I will be your mamma,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“We will play that you are my little girl. And Emily shall be your sister.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Shall she?” Lottie said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” answered Sara, jumping to her feet.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Let us go and tell her. And then I will wash your face and brush your hair.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Lottie agreed quite cheerfully.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not seem to remember the issue of the last hour.</p>
<p class="text-left">Actually, it had been caused by the fact that she had refused to be washed and brushed for lunch.</p>
<p class="text-left">And from that time Sara was an adopted mother( 养母 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The greatest power Sara had was her power of telling stories.</p>
<p class="text-left">She could make everything she talked about seem like a story, whether it was one or not.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara not only could tell stories, but she loved telling them.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she sat or stood in the middle of a circle and began to invent wonderful things, her green eyes grew big and shining, and her cheeks reddened.</p>
<p class="text-left">She began to act, making her story lovely or alarming by raising or dropping her voice and moving her hands.</p></div>

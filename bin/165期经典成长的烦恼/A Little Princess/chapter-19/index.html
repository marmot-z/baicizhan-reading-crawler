                        <div><p class="text-left">“Here, poor little girl,” he said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Here is a sixpence. I will give it to you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara started, and all at once realized that she looked exactly like poor children she had seen in her better days.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, no!” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, no, thank you! I mustn’t take it, indeed!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Her voice was so unlike an ordinary street child’s voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her manner was so like the manner of a well brought up little person that Veronica Eustacia (whose real name was Janet) and Rosalind Gladys (who was really called Nora) moved forward to listen.</p>
<p class="text-left">But Guy Clarence (who was really called Donald) put the sixpence in her hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, you must take it, poor little girl!” he said firmly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You can buy things to eat with it. It is a whole sixpence!”</p>
<p class="text-left">There was something so honest and kind in his face.</p>
<p class="text-left">He looked likely to be sadly disappointed if she did not take it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara knew she must not refuse him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Thank you,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You are a kind, kind little darling thing.”</p>
<p class="text-left">He climbed happily into the carriage.</p>
<p class="text-left">She went away, trying to smile, though she caught her breath quickly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her eyes were shining through a mist.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had known that she looked strange and poor, but until now she had not known that she might be taken for a beggar.</p>
<p class="text-left">As the Large Family’s carriage drove away, the children inside it were talking with interested excitement.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara knew nothing about the fact, but from that time the Large Family was as interested in her as she was in it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Faces used to appear at the nursery windows when she passed, and many discussions concerning her were held round the fire.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is a kind of servant at the school,” Janet said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t believe she belongs to anybody.</p>
<p class="text-left">I believe she is an orphan( 孤儿 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">But she is not a beggar, however poor she looks.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And later she was called by all of them, “The-little-girl-who-is-not-a-beggar.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara managed to bore( 钻孔 ) a hole in the sixpence and hung it on an old bit of thin ribbon round her neck.</p>
<p class="text-left">Though she was very fond of the Large Family, she remained quite lonely in her attic room.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had wished very much that someone would take the empty house next door.</p>
<p class="text-left">She wished it because of the attic window which was so near hers.</p>
<p class="text-left">It would be so nice to see it open one day and a head and shoulders rising out of the square opening.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If it looked a nice head,” she thought, “I might begin by saying, ‘Good morning,’ and all sorts of things might happen.”</p>
<p class="text-left">One morning, on turning the corner of the square after a visit to the grocer’s, the butcher’s, and the baker’s, she saw something that made her very happy.</p>
<p class="text-left">During her long absence, a van( 货车 ) full of furniture had stopped before the next house.</p>
<p class="text-left">The front doors were thrown open, and men were going in and out carrying heavy packages and pieces of furniture.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s taken!” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It really is taken! Oh, I do hope a nice head will look out of the attic window!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Several pieces of furniture had been set out of the van upon the pavement.</p>
<p class="text-left">There was a beautiful wooden table, and some chairs, and a screen covered with rich Oriental( 东方的 ) design.</p>
<p class="text-left">The sight of them gave her a strange, homesick( 思乡的 ) feeling.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had seen things so like them in India.</p>
<p class="text-left">All the furniture was rich and beautiful, and a great deal of it was Oriental.</p>
<p class="text-left">Wonderful carpets and curtains were taken from the vans, many pictures, and books enough for a library.</p>
<p class="text-left">Among other things there was a statue of the god Buddha( 佛像 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Someone in the family must have been in India,” Sara thought.</p>
<p class="text-left">“They have got used to Indian things and like them.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am glad.</p>
<p class="text-left">I shall feel as if they were friends, even if a head never looks out of the attic window.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When she was taking in the evening’s milk for the cook (there was really no job she was not called upon to do), she saw something which made the situation more interesting than ever.</p>
<p class="text-left">The handsome man who was the father of the Large Family walked across the square, and ran up the steps of the next-door house.</p>
<p class="text-left">He ran up them as if he felt quite at home and expected to run up and down them many a time in the future.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was quite certain that he was in some close way connected with the newcomers.</p>
<p class="text-left">At night, after her work was done, Becky came in to see her fellow prisoner and bring her news.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s an Indian gentleman that’s coming to live next door, miss,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He’s very rich, and he’s ill, and the gentleman of the Large Family is his lawyer.</p>
<p class="text-left">He’s had a lot of trouble, and it’s made him ill and low in his mind.”</p></div>

DADDY-LONG-LEGS

Blue Wednesday

The first Wednesday in every month was a Perfectly Awful Day.

It was a day that one waited for with fear, tried to get through with courage, and forgot as soon as possible.

Every floor must be perfectly clean, every chair free of dust( 灰尘 ), and every bed without a wrinkle( 褶皱 ).

Ninety-seven little orphans( 孤儿 ) must be washed and dressed in their best clothes.

All ninety-seven must be reminded( 被提醒 ) of their manners, and told to say, “Yes, sir,” “No, sir,” whenever a Trustee( 董事 ) spoke.

It was a difficult time, and poor Jerusha Abbott, being the oldest orphan, had to bear the worst of it.

But this particular first Wednesday, like the others before it, finally came to an end.

Jerusha left the kitchen where she had been making sandwiches for the guests, and went upstairs( 上楼 ) to finish her regular( 日常的 ) work.

Her special care was room F, where eleven little children, from four to seven years old, had their eleven little beds all in a row.

Jerusha lined them up, straightened their dresses, and wiped their noses.

Then she led them in an orderly and willing line towards the dining room to enjoy a happy half hour with bread and milk and fruit pudding.

Then she dropped down on the window seat and rested her aching( 疼痛的 ) head against the cool glass.

She had been on her feet since five that morning, taking orders from everyone, scolded( 训斥 ) and hurried by a nervous matron( 女总管 ).

Mrs. Lippett, behind the scenes, was not always as calm( 冷静 )—or as kind—as she tried to appear when she faced the Trustees.

Jerusha looked out across the lawn( 草坪 ), beyond the tall iron fence( 围栏 ), to the village in the distance.

The day had ended—quite successfully, as far as she knew.

The Trustees had toured the property, and read their reports, and drunk their tea.

Now they were hurrying back to their own cheerful homes, to forget about the orphans and their problems for another month.

Jerusha watched all the cars as they left.

In her imagination she followed first one car, then another, back to the big houses where their owners lived.

She saw herself in a fur coat( 裘皮大衣 ) and an expensive hat, sitting back in the seat and saying “Home” to the driver.

But at the door of her imagined home, the picture grew blurred( 模糊的 ).

Jerusha had an imagination—such a powerful one that Mrs. Lippett had even told her that her imagination would get her into trouble if she didn’t take care.

But her imagination could not carry her beyond the front door of that home.

Poor little Jerusha, in all her seventeen years, had never stepped inside an ordinary house.

She could not picture the daily life of those other humans who lived their lives without having to look after orphans.

Je-ru-sha Ab-bott

You are wan-ted

In the of-fice,

And I think you’d

Better hurry up!

Tommy Dillon’s singing grew louder as he got nearer to room F. Jerusha tore herself away( 依依不舍地离开 ) from the window and faced the troubles of life again.

“Who wants me?” she asked Tommy, anxiously( 紧张地 ).

Mrs. Lippett in the office,

And I think she’s angry.

Ah-a-men!

Tommy was having a little fun by singing the message as if it were a hymn( 赞美诗 ), but he was not trying to be cruel.

Even the most hardened little orphan felt sorry for someone sent to the office to face an angry matron.

And Tommy liked Jerusha, even if she did sometimes pull him by the arm and wash his face much too hard.

Jerusha wondered what could have gone wrong.

Were the sandwiches not thin enough?

Had a lady visitor seen the hole in Susie Hawthorn’s stocking( 长袜 )?

Worst of all—had one of the sweet little children in her own room F been rude to a Trustee?

The long lower hall had not been lighted.

As she came down the stairs, a last Trustee stood in the open door.

Jerusha noticed only one thing about the man—that he was very tall.

He was waving( 挥动 ) his arm to let the driver of his car know that he was ready to leave.

As the car came nearer, its headlights( 头灯 ) threw his shadow( 影子 ) sharply( 清晰地 ) against the wall inside.

The shadow had very long legs and arms that ran along the floor and up the wall.

It looked exactly like a huge daddy-long-legs.

Jerusha’s worry suddenly changed to laughter.

She was by nature a happy person, and would laugh at anything even a little bit funny.

If one could get any sort of fun out of a serious person such as a Trustee, then that was an unexpected pleasure.

She walked on to the office looking much happier, and presented a smiling face to Mrs. Lippett.

To her surprise, the matron was also, if not exactly smiling, at least relatively friendly.

She wore an expression almost as pleasant as the one she used for visitors.
<hr>
“Sit down, Jerusha, I have something to say to you.”

Jerusha dropped into the nearest chair and waited anxiously( 不安地 ).

A car passed quickly by the window, and Mrs. Lippett turned to look at it.

“Did you notice the gentleman who has just gone?”

“I saw his back.”

“He is one of our most generous( 慷慨的 ) Trustees( 董事 ), and has given large amounts of money to support our work.

I am not allowed to tell you his name.

He was very clear that he wished to remain unknown.”

Jerusha’s eyes widened slightly.

She was not used to being called to the office to discuss the strange behavior( 行为 ) of Trustees with the matron( 女总管 ).

“This gentleman has taken an interest in several of our boys.

You remember Charles Benton and Henry Freize?

They were both sent through college by Mr. —by this Trustee. Both have repaid( 回报 ), with their hard work and success, the money that was so generously spent on them.

The gentleman does not wish for any other payment.

Up till now, his generosity has been directed towards the boys only.

I have never been able to interest him in any of our girls, no matter how deserving( 值得的 ).

He does not care for girls.”

“No, ma’am,” Jerusha replied, since some reply seemed to be expected at this point.

“Today at our meeting, the question of your future was discussed.”

Mrs. Lippett was silent for a moment, then continued in a slow, quiet manner that only made Jerusha’s nervousness worse.

“Usually, as you know, the children are not kept after they are sixteen, but an exception was made in your case.

You finished our school at fourteen.

You have done very well in your studies—though your behavior has not always been what it should be.

So we decided to let you go to the village high school.

Now you are finishing that, and of course we can no longer support you.

As it is, you have had two years more than most.”

Mrs. Lippett did not mention the fact that Jerusha had worked hard for her food and her room during those two years.

Nor that the convenience( 方便 ) of the Orphans’ Home( 孤儿院 ) had always come first and her education second, and that on days like this one, she had to miss school to help out at the Home.

“As I say, the question of your future was brought up and your record was discussed—thoroughly( 深入地 ) discussed.”

Mrs. Lippett brought accusing( 责备的 ) eyes to bear upon the prisoner( 犯人 ) in the dock( 被怀疑做了坏事 ).

The prisoner looked guilty( 愧疚的 ) because it seemed to be expected—not because she could remember any strikingly black pages in her record.

“Of course, normally( 正常来说 ) we would place you in a position where you could begin to work.

But you have done well in school in certain subjects.

It seems that your work in English has even been brilliant( 优秀的 ).

Miss Pritchard, who is on our visiting committee( 委员会 ), is also on the school board.

She has been talking with your English teacher, and made a speech in your favor.

She also read aloud an essay( 论文 ) that you had written called, ‘Blue Wednesday.’ ”

Jerusha’s guilty expression this time was quite genuine( 真实的 ).

“It seemed to me that you were very rude( 无礼的 ) in making fun of the Home that has done so much for you.

If you had not managed to be funny, I doubt if you would have been forgiven( 被原谅 ).

But fortunately( 幸运的 ) for you, Mr. —, that is, the gentleman who has just gone—appears to have an over-developed sense of humor.

On the strength of that ungrateful( 不知感激的 ) paper, he has offered to send you to college.”

“To college?” Jerusha’s eyes grew big.

Mrs. Lippett nodded.

“He waited to discuss the terms with me.

They are unusual.

The gentleman, I may say, is a little unusual himself.

He believes that you have originality, and he is planning to educate you to become a writer.”

“A writer?” Jerusha could only repeat Mrs. Lippett’s words.

“That is his wish.

Whether anything will come of it, the future will show.

All your fees will be paid directly to the college.

During the four years you are there, you also will receive an allowance( 零用钱 ) of thirty-five dollars a month.

This is to allow you to live a similar life to the other students.

In my opinion, for a girl who has never had any experience in handling( 处理 ) money, it is too much.

But that is his plan, and I did not feel free to make any suggestions.

You are to remain here through the summer, and Miss Pritchard has kindly agreed to make sure you have clothes suitable( 合适的 ) for college.

“The money will be sent to you by the gentleman’s private secretary once a month.

In return, you will write a letter once a month.

In this letter you are not to thank him for the money.

He doesn’t care to have that mentioned.

But you are to write a letter telling of your progress in your studies and the details( 细节 ) of your daily life.

It should be the kind of letter that you would write to your parents, if you had any.
<hr>
“These letters will be addressed to Mr. John Smith and will be sent in care of the secretary.

The gentleman’s name is not John Smith, but he wishes to remain unknown.

To you he will never be anyone but John Smith.

He wants you to write to him because he thinks that writing letters is the best way to become a good writer.

Since you have no family to write to, he wants you to write to him instead.

Also, he wishes to follow your progress.

He will never answer your letters, nor take any notice of them in any way.

He hates writing letters, and does not wish to be forced to write back.

If you find yourself in a situation where an answer is needed, you may write to Mr. Griggs, his secretary.

You must send these monthly letters.

They are the only payment that Mr. Smith requires, so you must be as conscientious( 谨慎 ) in sending them as though you were paying a bill.

I hope that they will always be respectful.

You must remember that you are writing to a Trustee( 董事 ) of the John Grier Home.”

Jerusha’s eyes looked towards the door.

She wished only to get away and think.

She rose and took a small step back.

But Mrs. Lippett thought it was a perfect opportunity to make a speech to her.

“I trust that you are properly grateful( 感激 ) for your good luck?

Not many girls in your position ever have such an opportunity to rise in the world.

You must always remember—”

“I—yes, ma’am, thank you.

If that’s all, I must go and fix Freddie Perkins’s trousers.”

The door closed behind her, and Mrs. Lippett watched it with an open mouth.

The girl had given her no chance to make her great speech.

The Letters of Miss Jerusha Abbott to Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith

215 FERGUSSEN HALL

September 24th

Dear Kind-Trustee-Who-Sends-Orphans-to-College,

Here I am!

I travelled yesterday for four hours in a train.

It’s a funny feeling, isn’t it?

I never rode in one before.

College is the biggest, most confusing( 复杂的 ) place—I get lost whenever I leave my room.

I will write you a description later when I’m feeling less confused.

Also, I will tell you about my lessons.

Classes don’t begin until Monday morning, and this is Saturday night.

But I wanted to write a letter first, so that you can get to know me.

It seems strange to be writing letters to somebody you don’t know.

It seems strange for me to be writing letters at all.

I’ve never written more than three or four in my life, so please forgive me if these are not quite the kind you were expecting.

Before leaving yesterday morning, Mrs. Lippett and I had a very serious talk.

She told me how to behave( 举止规矩有礼 ) all the rest of my life, and especially how to behave towards the kind gentleman who is doing so much for me.

I must take care to be Very Respectful.

But how can one be very respectful to a person who wishes to be called John Smith?

Why couldn’t you have picked out a name with a little personality( 个性 )?

I have been thinking about you a great deal this summer.

Having somebody take an interest in me after all these years makes me feel as though I had found a sort of family.

I feel as if I belonged( 属于 ) to somebody now, and it’s a very comfortable feeling.

But I must say that when I think about you, my imagination has very little to work upon.

There are just three things that I know:

1. You are tall.

2. You are rich.

3. You hate girls.

I suppose I might call you Dear Mr. Girl-Hater.

Only that’s rather insulting( 侮辱的 ) to me.

Or Dear Mr. Rich-Man, but that’s insulting to you, as though money were the only important thing about you. Besides, maybe you won’t stay rich all your life.

Lots of very clever men have lost everything on Wall Street. But at least you will stay tall all your life!

So I’ve decided to call you Dear Daddy-Long-Legs.

I hope you won’t mind.

It’s just a private pet name( 昵称 ) we won’t tell Mrs. Lippett about.

The ten o’clock bell is going to ring in two minutes.

Our day is divided into sections by bells.

We eat and sleep and study by bells.

I feel like a fireman( 消防员 ) who must run when he hears the fire-bell.

There it goes! Lights out. Good night.

Notice how well I obey( 遵守 ) the rules—due to my training in the John Grier Home.

Yours most respectfully,

Jerusha Abbott
<hr>
October 1st

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I love college and I love you for sending me!

I’m very, very happy, and so excited every moment that I can hardly sleep.

You can’t imagine how different it is from the John Grier Home.

I never dreamed there was such a place in the world.

I’m feeling sorry for everybody who isn’t a girl and who can’t come here.

I am sure the college you went to when you were a boy couldn’t have been so nice.

My room is up in a tower where they used to put sick girls so the others couldn’t catch their diseases( 疾病 ).

That was before they built the new infirmary( 医务室 ).

There are three other girls on the same floor of the tower.

There’s a fourth-year student who wears glasses and is always asking us to please be a little quieter.

And there are two other first-year students, named Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton.

Sallie has red hair and a turned-up nose and is quite friendly.

Julia comes from one of the most important families in New York( 纽约，地名 ) and hasn’t noticed me yet.

They share a room, and the fourth-year student and I have single rooms.

Usually first-year students can’t get single rooms.

There are very few single rooms, but I got one without even asking.

I suppose they didn’t think it would be right to ask a properly brought-up girl to share a room with an orphan( 孤儿 ).

You see there are advantages!

My room is on the northwest corner, with two windows and a view.

After you’ve lived in a dormitory( 宿舍 ) for eighteen years with twenty other girls, it is restful to be alone.

This is the first chance I’ve ever had to get to know Jerusha Abbott.

I think I’m going to like her.

Do you think you are?

Tuesday

They are organizing the first-year basketball team, and there’s just a chance that I shall get in it.

I’m little of course, but very quick and strong and tough( 结实的 ).

While the others are jumping about in the air, I can move in quickly under their feet and take the ball.

It’s fun practicing out in the athletic( 运动的 ) field in the afternoon.

The trees are all red and yellow, and the air is full of the smell of burning leaves.

And everybody is laughing and shouting.

These are the happiest girls I ever saw—and I am the happiest of all!

I meant to write a long letter and tell you all the things I’m learning. (Mrs. Lippett said you wanted to know.)

But the bell for 7th period has just rung, and in ten minutes I’m due at the sports field in my exercise clothes.

Don’t you hope I’ll get in the team?

Yours always,

Jerusha Abbott

P.S. (9 o’clock.)

Sallie McBride just put her head in at my door.

This is what she said:

“I’m so homesick( 想家的 ) that I simply can’t stand it. Do you feel that way?”

I smiled a little and said no: I thought I could survive( 挺过来 ) it.

At least homesickness is one problem that I’ve never had!

I’ve never heard of anybody being homesick for an Orphans’ Home, have you?

October 10th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Did you ever hear of Michelangelo( 米开朗琪罗，人名 )?

He was a famous artist who lived in Italy( 意大利 ) in the Middle Ages.

Everybody in English Literature( 英语文学课 ) seemed to know about him, and the whole class laughed because I thought he was an angel( 天使 ).

He sounds like one, doesn’t he?

The trouble with college is that you are expected to know such a lot of things you’ve never learned.

It’s very embarrassing( 尴尬的 ) at times.

But now, when the girls talk about things that I never heard of, I just keep quiet and look them up later in the encyclopedia( 百科全书 ).

I made an awful mistake the first day.

Somebody mentioned Maurice Maeterlinck, and I asked if she was a first-year.

That joke has gone all over college.

But anyway, I’m just as bright in class as any of the others—and brighter than some of them!

Everything in my room is brown or yellow.

The walls are painted brown, and I’ve bought yellow curtains( 窗帘 ) and a dark brown wooden desk (second-hand for three dollars).

Then there’s a chair and a brown carpet( 地毯 ) with an ink( 墨水 ) stain( 污渍 ) in the middle.

I place the chair over the stain.

Sallie McBride helped me choose the things.

She has lived in a house all her life and knows about furniture( 家具 ).

You can’t imagine what fun it is to shop and pay with a real five-dollar bill and get some change—when you’ve never had more than a few cents in your life.

Thank you so much, Daddy dear, for that allowance( 零用钱 ).

Sallie is the most entertaining( 有趣的 ) person in the world—and Julia Rutledge Pendleton the least.

The college has given me a rather strange mixture of roommates( 室友 ).

Sallie thinks everything is funny—even failing exams—and Julia is bored with everything.

She never makes the slightest effort to be friendly.

She believes that if you are a Pendleton, you go to Heaven( 天堂 ) because of that fact alone.

Julia and I were born to be enemies.

And now I suppose you’ve been waiting very impatiently( 不耐烦地 ) to hear what I am learning?

Latin( 拉丁语 ): Second Punic war( 第二次布匿克战争 ).

Hannibal and his forces camped at Lake Trasimenus last night.

They prepared an ambush( 埋伏 ) for the Romans( 罗马人 ), and a battle took place early in the morning.

Romans lost.

II. French: 24 pages of The Three Musketeers.

III. Geometry( 几何学 ): Finished cylinders( 圆柱体 ); now doing cones( 圆锥体 ).

IV. English: My style improves( 进步 ) daily in clearness( 清晰 ) and brevity( 简洁 ).

V. Physiology( 生理学 ): Reached the digestive( 消化的 ) system.

Yours, on the way to being educated,

Jerusha Abbott

P.S. I hope you never touch alcohol( 酒 ), Daddy? It’s really bad for your liver( 肝脏 ).
<hr>
Wednesday

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I’ve changed my name.

I’m still “Jerusha” officially for the school, but I’m “Judy” everywhere else.

It’s really too bad, isn’t it, to have to give yourself the only nickname( 昵称 ) you ever had?

I didn’t quite make up the Judy though.

That’s what Freddy Perkins used to call me before he could talk properly.

I wish Mrs. Lippett would put a little more thought into choosing babies’ names.

She gets the last names out of the telephone book—you’ll find Abbott on the first page—and she picks the first names up anywhere.

She got Jerusha from a tombstone( 墓碑 ).

I’ve always hated it; but I rather like Judy.

It’s such a silly name. It sounds like exactly the kind of girl I’m not—a sweet little blue-eyed thing, loved and petted by all the family, who goes happily through life without any cares.

Wouldn’t it be nice to be like that?

Whatever faults I may have, no one can ever say that I’ve been spoiled( 被宠坏的 ) by my family!

But it’s great fun to pretend( 假装 ) I have been. In the future please always call me Judy.

Do you want to know something?

I have three pairs of gloves.

These are the first gloves I’ve ever had that have five fingers.

(Dinner bell. Goodbye.)

Friday

Can you believe this, Daddy?

The English instructor said that my last paper showed a lot of originality.

She did, truly.

Those were her words.

It doesn’t seem possible, does it, considering the eighteen years of training that I’ve had?

The aim( 目的 ) of the John Grier Home (which you probably know and agree with) is to turn the ninety-seven orphans( 孤儿 ) into ninety-seven exact copies of each other.

My unusual artistic ability was developed at an early age by drawing chalk( 粉笔的 ) pictures of Mrs. Lippett.

I hope that I don’t hurt your feelings when I criticize( 批评 ) the home of my youth?

But you have the advantage, you know, for if I say something you really don’t like, you can always stop paying.

That isn’t a very polite thing to say—but you can’t expect me to have any manners.

A home for orphans isn’t a young ladies’ finishing school.

You know, Daddy, it isn’t the work that is going to be hard in college.

It’s the play.

Half the time I don’t know what the girls are talking about.

Their jokes seem to be about a past that everyone but me has shared.

I’m a foreigner in their world, and I don’t understand the language.

It’s a miserable( 痛苦的 ) feeling.

I’ve had it all my life.

At the high school the girls would stand in groups and just look at me.

I was strange and different, and everybody knew it.

I could feel “John Grier Home” written on my face.

And then some of them would make an effort to be polite.

I hated every one of them—but most of all, I hated the ones who tried to be polite.

Nobody here knows that I was brought up in an Orphans’ Home.

I told Sallie McBride that my mother and father were dead.

And I said that a kind old gentleman was sending me to college, which is true so far as it goes.

I don’t want you to think I was afraid to tell the whole truth.

But I do want to be like the other girls.

That Dreadful( 可怕的 ) Home hanging over my childhood is the one great big difference.

If I can turn my back on that and forget it all, I think I might be just as good as any other girl.

I don’t believe there’s any real, underneath difference, do you?

Anyway, Sallie McBride likes me!

Yours ever,

Judy Abbott

Saturday morning

I’ve just been reading this letter over and it sounds pretty uncheerful( 不快乐的 ).

But can’t you guess that I have to write a special essay( 论文 ) before Monday morning, and there’ll be a geometry( 几何学 ) test, and I have a very bad cold?

Sunday

I forgot to post this yesterday, so I will add an angry postscript( 附言 ).

We had a bishop( 主教 ) this morning, and what do you think he said?

“The kindest promise made us in the Bible( 圣经 ) is this, ‘The poor will always be with you.’

They were put here in order to keep us charitable( 仁慈的 ).”

The poor, please notice, are just put there to be useful to us.

If I hadn’t grown into such a perfect lady, I should have gone up after the service and told him what I thought.

October 25th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I’m in the basketball team, and you ought to see the bruise( 淤青 ) on my left shoulder.

It’s blue and brown, with little areas of orange.

Julia Pendleton tried for the team, but she didn’t get in.

Hooray( 万岁 )!

You see what a mean girl I am.

College gets nicer and nicer.

I like the girls and the teachers and the classes and the buildings and the things to eat.

We have ice cream( 冰激凌 ) twice a week and we never have cornmeal( 玉米片 ) porridge( 粥 ) like we did in the Home.

You only wanted to hear from me once a month, didn’t you?

And I’ve been bothering( 烦扰 ) you with letters every few days!

But I’ve been so excited about all these new happenings that I must talk to somebody; and you’re the only one I know.

Please excuse my enthusiasm( 激动 ); I’ll settle down( 平静下来 ) pretty soon.

If my letters bore you, you can always throw them into the wastebasket( 垃圾桶 ).

I promise not to write another till the middle of November.

Yours,

Judy Abbott

November 15th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

You’ve never heard about my clothes, have you, Daddy?

Six dresses, all new and beautiful and bought for me—not handed down from somebody bigger.

Perhaps you don’t realize how exciting that is for an orphan?

You gave them to me, and I am very, very, very grateful.
<hr>
It’s a fine thing to be educated—but nothing compared to the experience of owning six new dresses.

Miss Pritchard, who is on the visiting committee( 委员会 ), picked them out—not Mrs. Lippett, thank goodness.

I have an evening dress of pink silk (I’m perfectly beautiful in that), and a blue church dress, and a red dinner dress with Oriental( 东方风情的 ) trim( 剪裁 ) (which makes me look like a Gipsy).

And I have another of rose-colored lace( 蕾丝 ), and a gray street suit( 套装 ), and an everyday dress for classes.

That wouldn’t be a very big collection of clothes for Julia Rutledge Pendleton, perhaps, but for Jerusha Abbott—Oh, my!

Dear Daddy, aren’t you glad you’re not a girl?

I suppose you think that the fuss( 无谓的激动 ) we make over clothes is very silly?

It is. No doubt about it. But it’s entirely your fault( 错误 ).

I suppose you’re thinking now what a silly, shallow( 肤浅的 ) little beast( 野兽 ) I am, and what a waste of money it is to educate a girl?

But, Daddy, if you’d been dressed in checked cotton( 棉质的 ) dresses all your life, you’d understand how I feel.

And when I started going to the high school, that was an even worse time.

My dresses came from the poor box.

You can’t know how I hated appearing in school in those horrible( 可怕的 ) poor-box dresses.

I would always be placed next to the girl who first owned my dress.

She would whisper( 窃窃私语 ) to the others.

The bitterness( 怨恨 ) of wearing your enemies’ old clothes eats away at you.

If I wore silk stockings( 长袜 ) for the rest of my life, I don’t believe it ever heals( 愈合 ) the hurt I still feel.

Yours ever,

J. Abbott

P.S. I know I’m not to expect any letters in return, and I’ve been warned not to bother( 烦扰 ) you with questions, but tell me, Daddy, just this once—are you awfully old or just a little old?

And are you bald( 秃头的 )?

Since I don’t really know anything about you, I have to think about you like a problem in mathematics( 数学 ): given a tall rich man who hates girls, but is very generous( 慷慨的 ) to one girl, what does he look like?

Please, tell me!

December 19th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

You never answered my question and it was very important.

ARE YOU BALD?

I have it planned exactly what you look like—very satisfactorily—until I reach the top of your head, and then I am stuck.

I can’t decide whether you have white hair or black hair, or maybe none at all.

Here is your picture:

But the problem is, shall I add some hair?

Would you like to know what color your eyes are?

They’re gray, and you have very big eyebrows( 眉毛 ).

Your mouth is a straight line that turns down at the corners.

Oh, you see, I know!

You’re a grumpy( 脾气坏的 ) old man.

(The bell has rung, so I must go.)

9.45 p.m.

I have a new rule that I will always keep.

I will never, never study at night, no matter how many tests I have in the morning.

Instead, I read just ordinary books.

I have to, because there are eighteen empty years behind me.

You wouldn’t believe, Daddy, how deep the ignorance( 无知 ) of my mind is; I am only just finding out myself.

Most girls with a normal family and a home and friends and a library learn things naturally.

I don’t.

For example:

I never read Cinderella or Robinson Crusoe or Jane Eyre or Alice in Wonderland or a word of Rudyard Kipling.

I didn’t know that people used to be monkeys and that the Garden of Eden was a beautiful myth( 神话 ).

I didn’t know that R. L. S. stood for Robert Louis Stevenson.

I had never seen a picture of the “Mona Lisa” and (It’s true but you won’t believe it.)

I had never heard of Sherlock Holmes.

Now, I know all of these things and a lot of others as well, but you can see how much I need to catch up.

And it’s such fun!

I look forward all day to the evening, and then I put a “Do not disturb( 请勿打扰 )” sign on the door and light the lamp( 灯 ), and read and read and read.

One book isn’t enough. I have four going at once.

Just now, they’re Tennyson’s poems and Thackeray’s “Vanity Fair( 名利场 )” and Kipling’s “Plain Tales from the Hills( 山中故事 )” and—don’t laugh—Louisa Alcott’s “Little Women.”

I find that I am the only girl in college who wasn’t brought up on “Little Women.”

I haven’t told anybody though.

(That would make everyone think I was a strange girl.)

I just quietly went and bought it with $1.12 of my last month’s allowance( 零用钱 )!

(Ten o’clock bell. This is a very interrupted( 被打断的 ) letter.)

Sunday

The Christmas holidays begin next week and everyone has already packed( 打包 ) away the things they won’t need at home.

The corridors( 走廊 ) are so filled up that you can hardly get through.

Everybody is so full of excitement that studying is taking second place.

I’m going to have a beautiful time over the holidays.

There’s another first-year who lives in Texas staying behind, and we are planning to take long walks.

If there’s any ice, we’ll learn to skate.

Then there is still the whole library to be read—and three empty weeks to do it in!

Goodbye, Daddy, I hope that you are feeling as happy as I am.

Yours ever,

Judy

P.S. Don’t forget to answer my question.

If you don’t want the trouble of writing, have your secretary send a letter.

He can just say:

Mr. Smith is quite bald,

or

Mr. Smith is not bald,

or

Mr. Smith has white hair.

And you can take the cost of the stamp out of my allowance.

Goodbye till January—and a merry Christmas( 圣诞快乐 )!
<hr>


Towards the end of the Christmas vacation.

Exact date unknown

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Is it snowing where you are?

Everything that I see from my tower is covered in white, and the snowflakes( 雪花 ) are coming down as big as popcorn( 爆米花 ).

It’s late afternoon—the sun is just setting (a cold yellow color) behind some colder blue hills.

I am up in my window seat, using the last light to write to you.

Your five gold pieces were a surprise!

I’m not used to receiving Christmas presents.

You have already given me such lots of things—everything I have, you know—that I don’t quite feel that I deserve( 应得 ) anything more.

But I like them, just the same.

Do you want to know what I bought with my money?

1. A watch to get me to class in time.

2. Matthew Arnold’s poems.

3. A hot water bottle.

4. A warm blanket( 毯子 ) to wrap( 用...包 ) around me. (My tower is cold.)

5. Five hundred sheets( 张 ) of yellow writing paper. (I’m going to start being an author pretty soon.)

6. A dictionary of synonyms( 同义词 ) (to enlarge the author’s vocabulary( 词汇量 )).

7. (I don’t much like to tell you this last one, but I will.) A pair of silk stockings( 长筒袜 ).

And now, Daddy, never say I don’t tell all!

To be honest, I had a very wrong reason for buying the silk stockings.

Julia Pendleton comes into my room to do geometry( 几何学 ), and she wears silk stockings every night.

But just wait—as soon as she gets back from vacation I shall go to her room in my silk stockings.

You see, Daddy, I’m not a good person, but at least I’m honest.

You knew already, from my record at the Home, that I wasn’t perfect, didn’t you?

To sum( 总结 ) up (that’s the way the English instructor begins every other sentence), I am very grateful( 感激的 ) for my seven presents.

I’m pretending( 假装 ) to myself that they came in a box from my family in California.

The watch is from father, and the blanket from mother.

The hot water bottle is from grandmother, who is always afraid I will catch cold.

The yellow paper is from my little brother Harry.

My sister Isabel gave me the silk stockings, and Aunt Susan gave me the Matthew Arnold poems.

Uncle Harry (little Harry is named after him) gave me the dictionary.

He wanted to send chocolates, but I said that I must have synonyms.

You don’t object, do you, to playing the part of a whole family?

And now, shall I tell you about my vacation, or are you only interested in my education?

The girl from Texas is named Leonora Fenton.

I like her, but not so much as Sallie McBride.

I shall never like any one so much as Sallie—except you. I must always like you the best of all, because you’re my whole family combined( 合并 ) into one.

Leonora and I and two second-year girls have walked across the fields every pleasant day.

We have explored( 探索 ) the whole neighborhood, dressed in short skirts and jackets and caps, and carrying sticks to protect ourselves with if we have to.

Once we walked into town—four miles—and stopped at a restaurant where the college girls go for dinner.

Baked( 烘烤的 ) lobster( 龙虾 ) (35 cents), and for dessert( 甜点 ), pancakes and maple syrup( 槭糖浆 ) (15 cents). Filling and cheap.

It was such fun! Especially for me, because it was so different from the Home.

I feel like an escaped( 逃跑的 ) prisoner( 犯人 ) every time I leave the college grounds.

Before I thought, I started to tell the others what an experience I was having.

The cat was almost out of the bag when I got hold of it by its tail and pulled it back.

It’s awfully hard for me not to tell everything I know.

I’m a very talkative( 健谈的 ) person by nature.

If I didn’t have you to tell things to, I’d burst( 爆发 ).

We had a candy pull last Friday evening, given by the matron( 女舍监 ) of Fergussen for all the girls who haven’t gone home for Christmas.

There were twenty-two of us, first-, second-, third- and fourth-year girls all working happily together.

The kitchen is huge, with pots( 锅 ) hanging in rows on the stone wall—even the smallest of them is large enough to wash clothes in.

Four hundred girls live in Fergussen.

The cook wore a white cap and an apron( 围裙 ).

He gave us twenty-two other white caps and aprons—I can’t imagine where he got so many.

Then we all pretended to be cooks.

It was great fun, though I have seen better candy.

When it was finally finished, we and the kitchen and the door-knobs were sticky( 黏糊糊的 ) all over.

We organized a procession, still in our caps and aprons.

We marched through the empty corridors( 走廊 ) to the staff room, where the teachers were having a peaceful evening.

We sang college songs to them and offered them candy.

They accepted politely but rather doubtfully.

We left them chewing( 嚼 ) our candy, sticky and speechless.

So you see, Daddy, my education progresses!

Don’t you think that I ought to be an artist instead of an author?

Vacation will be over in two days and I shall be glad to see the girls again.

My tower is a little lonely; when nine people are living in a house that was built for four hundred, they do rattle( 在空荡的...居住 ) around a bit.

Eleven pages—poor Daddy, you must be tired!

I meant this to be just a short little thank-you note—but when I get started I seem to have a busy pen.

Goodbye, and thank you for thinking of me—I should be perfectly happy except for one little cloud on the horizon( 地平线 ).

Examinations come in February.

Yours with love,

Judy

P.S( 附言 ). Maybe it isn’t proper to send love?

If it isn’t, please excuse.

But I must love somebody and there’s only you and Mrs. Lippett to choose between, so you see—you’ll have to put up with it, Daddy dear, because I can’t love her.
<hr>
Before the Exams

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

You should see the way this college is studying!

We’ve forgotten we ever had a vacation.

I have introduced fifty-seven irregular( 不规则的 ) verbs( 动词 ) to my brain in the past four days—I’m only hoping they’ll stay till after examinations.

Some of the girls sell their textbooks( 教科书 ) when they’re through with them, but I’m going to keep mine.

Then after I’ve graduated( 毕业 ), I shall have my whole education in a row in the bookcase( 书架 ), and when I need to use any of it, I can find it at once.

So much easier and more accurate( 准确的 ) than trying to keep it in your head.

Julia Pendleton dropped in this evening to pay a social call, and stayed a whole hour.

She got started on the subject of family, and I couldn’t change the subject.

She wanted to know what my mother’s maiden( 娘家姓 ) name was.

I didn’t have the courage to say I didn’t know.

So I just decided on the first name I could think of, and that was Montgomery.

Then she wanted to know whether I was one of the Massachusetts Montgomerys or the Virginia Montgomerys.

Her mother was a Rutherford.

The family came over in the ark( 舟 ), and were connected by marriage with Henry the Eighth.

On her father’s side they date back further than Adam.

On the topmost branches( 分支 ) of her family tree there are some very high-class monkeys with very fine silky hair and long tails.

I meant to write you a nice, cheerful, entertaining( 使人愉快的 ) letter tonight, but I’m too sleepy—and scared( 害怕的 ).

The first-year student’s situation is not a happy one.

Yours, about to be examined,

Judy Abbott

Sunday

Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,

I have some awful, awful, awful news to tell you, but I won’t begin with it; I’ll try to get you in a good mood( 心情 ) first.

Jerusha Abbott is now a published( 出版过书的 ) author.

A poem called “From my Tower” appears in the February Monthly—on the first page, which is a very great honor( 荣幸 ) for a first-year.

My English instructor has told me that it is a charming( 迷人的 ) piece of work except for the sixth line, which had too many feet.

I will send you a copy in case you care to read it.

Let me see if I can’t think of something else pleasant—Oh, yes! I’m learning to skate, and can glide( 滑行 ) about quite respectably all by myself.

Also I’ve learned how to slide( 滑动 ) down a rope from the top of the gymnasium( 体育馆 ).

I can jump over a bar( 围栏 ) three feet and six inches( 英寸 ) high—I hope shortly to increase that up to four feet.

We had a very inspiring( 鼓舞人心的 ) sermon( 布道 ) this morning by the Bishop( 主教 ) of Alabama.

It was about the necessity of overlooking( 看漏 ) mistakes in others, and not discouraging( 使灰心 ) people by harsh( 严厉的 ) judgments( 看法 ).

I wish you had heard it.

This is the sunniest( 阳光最充足的 ), most blinding winter afternoon, with all the world bending( 弯曲 ) under a weight of snow—except me, and I’m bending under a weight of sorrow( 悲伤 ).

Now for the news—courage, Judy!—You must tell.

Are you really in a good mood?

I failed in mathematics and Latin( 拉丁语 ).

I’m taking extra( 额外的 ) classes in them, and will take another examination next month.

I’m sorry if you’re disappointed( 失望的 ), but otherwise I don’t care a bit because I’ve learned such a lot of things not mentioned in the college handbook( 手册 ).

I’ve read seventeen novels( 小说 ) and lots of poetry—really necessary novels like Vanity( 名利场 ) Fair and Alice in Wonderland.

Also the first half of Gibbon’s Roman Empire( 罗马帝国 ) and half of Benvenuto Cellini’s Life—wasn’t he entertaining?

He used to go for a walk and casually( 随意地 ) kill a man before breakfast.

So you see, Daddy, I’m much more well-read than if I’d just stuck to Latin.

Will you forgive( 原谅 ) me this once if I promise never to fail again?

Yours in sackcloth( 粗麻布 ),

Judy

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

This is an extra letter in the middle of the month because I’m rather lonely tonight.

It’s awfully stormy.

All the lights are out, but I drank black coffee and I can’t go to sleep.

I had a dinner party this evening with Sallie and Julia and Leonora Fenton.

We had sardines( 沙丁鱼 ) and hot muffins( 松饼 ) and salad and coffee.

Julia said she’d had a good time, but Sallie stayed to help wash the dishes.

I might, very usefully, put some time on Latin tonight but, there’s no doubt about it, I’m a very lazy Latin student.

Would you mind, just for a little while, pretending( 假装 ) you are my grandmother?

Sallie has one and Julia and Leonora each have two, and they were all comparing them tonight.

I can’t think of anything I’d rather have; it’s such a respectable relationship.

When I went into town yesterday, I saw the sweetest cap of Cluny lace( 蕾丝边 ).

So, if you don’t mind, I am going to give it to you on your eighty-third birthday.

! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

That’s the clock striking twelve.

I believe I am sleepy after all.

Good night, Granny( 外婆 ).

I love you dearly.

Judy



The Ides of March

Dear D. L. L.,

I am learning how to write Latin. I have been studying it.

I shall be studying it. I shall have been studying it.

My re-examination is at the 7th period next Tuesday, and I am going to pass or BUST( 失败 ).

I will write a respectable letter when it’s over.

Yours—in evident haste( 匆忙 ).

J. A.
<hr>
March 26th

Mr. D. L. L. Smith,

SIR: You never answer any questions; you never show the slightest interest in anything I do.

You are probably the nastiest( 最讨厌的 ) one of all those nasty Trustees( 董事 ).

The reason you are educating me is, not because you care a bit about me, but from a sense of Duty.

I don’t know a single thing about you.

I don’t even know your name.

It is very uninspiring( 无聊的 ) writing to a thing.

I am sure you throw my letters into the wastebasket( 废纸篓 ) without reading them.

From now on I shall write only about work.

My re-examinations in Latin( 拉丁语 ) and geometry( 几何学 ) were last week.

I passed them both, and am now free from conditions.

Yours truly,

Jerusha Abbott

April 2nd

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I am a BEAST( 野兽 ).

Please forget about that dreadful( 不光彩的 ) letter I sent you last week—I was feeling terribly lonely and miserable( 痛苦的 ) the night I wrote.

My throat( 咽喉 ) hurt.

I didn’t know it, but I was just sickening for tonsillitis( 扁桃体炎 ) and flu( 流感 ) and lots of things.

I’m in the infirmary( 医务室 ) now, and have been here for six days.

This is the first time they have let me sit up and have a pen and paper.

The head nurse is very bossy.

But I’ve been thinking about it all the time, and I shan’t get well until you forgive( 原谅 ) me.

Here is a picture of the way I look, with a bandage( 绷带 ) tied around my head in rabbit’s ears.

Doesn’t that make you feel sorry for me?

My sublingual glands( 舌下腺 ) are swollen( 肿胀的 ).

And I’ve been studying physiology( 生理学 ) all the year without ever having heard of them.

How useless education is!

I can’t write any more; I get rather shaky when I sit up too long.

Please forgive( 原谅 ) me for being rude( 粗鲁的 ) and ungrateful( 不感激的 ).

I was badly brought up.

Yours with love,

Judy Abbott

THE INFIRMARY( 医务室 )

April 4th

Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,

Yesterday evening just towards dark, I was sitting up in bed looking out at the rain and feeling awfully bored with life.

Then the nurse appeared with a long white box addressed to me, and filled with the loveliest pink roses.

And much nicer still, there was a card with a very polite message in it.

The handwriting was rather unusual, but showed a great deal of character.

Thank you, Daddy, a thousand times.

Your flowers are the first real, true present I ever received in my life.

If you want to know what a baby I am, I lay down and cried because I was so happy.

Now that I am sure you read my letters, I’ll make them much more interesting.

I hope they’ll be worth keeping in a safe with red tape around them.

Only please take out that horrible( 糟糕的 ) one and burn it.

I’d hate to think that you ever read it again.

Thank you for making a very sick, unhappy first-year student cheerful again.

Probably you have lots of loving family and friends, and you don’t know what it feels like to be alone.

But I do.

Goodbye—I’ll promise never to be nasty again, because now I know you’re a real person; also I’ll promise never to bother( 麻烦 ) you with any more questions.

Do you still hate girls?

Yours forever( 永远 ),

Judy

Thursday evening

What do you think is my favorite book?

Just now, I mean; I change every three days.

Wuthering Heights.

Emily Bronte was quite young when she wrote it, and she had never been outside of the grounds of Haworth church.

She had never known any men in her life; how could she imagine a man like Heathcliff?

I couldn’t do it, and I’m quite young and only recently left the John Grier Home, so in some ways I’m quite like Emily Bronte.

Sometimes I’m afraid that I’m not a genius( 天才 ).

Will you be very disappointed, Daddy, if I don’t turn out to be a great author?

In the spring, when everything is so beautiful and green and growing, I feel like turning my back on lessons, and running away to play with the weather.

There is so much fun to be had out in the fields!

It’s much more interesting to live an adventurous( 惊险刺激的 ) life than to write about one.

Ow!!!!!!

That was a scream( 尖叫 ) which brought Sallie and Julia and the fourth-year student from across the hall.

It was caused by a centipede( 蜈蚣 ) like this: only worse.

Just as I had finished the last sentence and was thinking what to say next, it fell off the ceiling( 天花板 ) and landed at my side.

I knocked two cups of tea off the table while trying to get away.

Sallie hit it with the back of my hair brush—which I shall never be able to use again—and killed the front end, but the back fifty feet ran under the furniture( 家具 ) and escaped( 逃走 ).

This part of the college, due to its age and ivy-covered walls, is full of centipedes.

They are horrible. I’d rather find a tiger under the bed.
<hr>
Friday, 9.30 p.m.

Such a lot of troubles!

I didn’t hear the rising bell this morning.

Then I broke my shoe-lace while I was hurrying to dress.

I was late for breakfast and also for first period.

I had a disagreement with my mathematics professor( 教授 ) about logarithms( 对数 ).

On looking it up, I find that she was right.

We had mutton( 羊肉 ) for lunch, which I hate—it tastes of the John Grier Home.

The mail( 邮件 ) brought me nothing but bills (obviously my family don’t write).

But this didn’t end the day.

There was worse to come.

It rained so we couldn’t play golf( 高尔夫 ), but had to go to the gymnasium( 体育馆 ) instead.

The girl next to me hit my elbow( 手肘 ) with an exercise club.

I got home to find that the box with my new blue spring dress had come, and the skirt was so tight( 紧的 ) that I couldn’t sit down.

Friday is cleaning day, and the cleaning lady had mixed up all the papers on my desk.

We were kept in chapel( 小教堂 ) twenty minutes later than usual to listen to a speech about womanly women.

And then—just as I was sitting down with The Portrait of a Lady( 一位贵妇的画像，书名 ), in came a very stupid girl named Ackerly.

She sits next to me in Latin( 拉丁语 ) class, because her name begins with A. (I wish Mrs. Lippett had named me Zabriski.)

She came to ask if Monday’s lesson begins at paragraph( 段落 ) 69 or 70, and stayed for ONE HOUR.

She has just gone.

Did you ever hear of such a discouraging( 令人沮丧的 ) series of events?

It isn’t the big troubles in life that require strength of character. Anybody can rise to a crisis( 危机 ) and face a tragedy( 悲剧 ) with courage.

But to meet the small difficulties of the day with a laugh—I really think that requires spirit.

It’s the kind of character that I am going to develop. I am going to pretend( 假装 ) that all life is just a game which I must play as skillfully and fairly as I can.

If I lose, I am going to shrug( 耸肩 ) my shoulders and laugh—also if I win.

Anyway, I am going to be a good sport.

You will never hear me complain( 抱怨 ) again, Daddy dear, because Julia wears silk stockings( 长袜 ) and centipedes( 蜈蚣 ) drop off the wall.

Yours ever,

Judy

Answer soon.

May 27th

Daddy-Long-Legs, Esq.

DEAR SIR: I have just received a letter from Mrs. Lippett.

She hopes that I am behaving well( 行为规矩 ), and doing well in my studies. I probably have no place to go this summer.

So she will let me come back to the Home and work for my food and accommodation( 住宿 ) until college opens.

I HATE THE JOHN GRIER HOME.

I’d rather die than go back.

Yours most truthfully,

Jerusha Abbott

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

You are wonderful! I am very happy about the farm, because I have never been on a farm in my life.

I’d hate to return to John Grier and wash dishes all summer.

There would be a danger of something terrible happening.

I have lost the humble( 谦逊的 ) attitude I had before, and I am afraid that I would just go wild and smash( 打碎 ) everything.

Forgive the shortness of this letter, and the paper.

I can’t tell you my latest news, because I am in French class, and I’m afraid the teacher is going to call on me.

He did!

Goodbye, I love you very much,

Judy.

May 30th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Did you ever see the campus( 校园 )?

It is so beautiful in May.

All the flowers have opened, and the trees are the loveliest young green.

The grass is dotted with( 星星点点布满 ) yellow dandelions( 蒲公英 ) and hundreds of girls in blue and white and pink dresses.

Everybody is happy and carefree( 无忧无虑的 ), for vacation’s coming.

With that to look forward to, examinations don’t count.

Isn’t that a happy state of mind to be in?

And oh, Daddy! I’m the happiest of all!

Because I’m not in the Home any more.

And I’m not anybody’s nursemaid( 保姆 ) or typist( 打字员 ) or bookkeeper( 簿记员 ). (I should have been, you know, without your help.)

I’m sorry now for everything I did wrong.

I’m sorry I was ever rude( 无礼的 ) to Mrs. Lippett.

I’m sorry I ever filled the sugar bowl with salt.

I’m sorry I ever made faces behind the Trustees( 董事 )’ backs.

I’m going to be good and sweet and kind to everybody because I’m so happy.

And this summer I’m going to write and write and write and begin to be a great author.

Isn’t that a noble( 崇高的 ) plan to make?

Oh, I’m developing a beautiful character!

It suffers( 受苦 ) a bit under cold and frost( 霜 ), but it grows fast when the sun shines.

That’s the way with everybody.

I don’t agree with the theory that sorrow( 悲伤 ) and disappointment( 失望 ) develop moral strength.

The happy people are the ones who are overflowing( 充满 ) with kindness.

I have no sympathy( 同情心 ) for misanthropes( 厌恶人类的人 ). (Fine word! Just learned it.)

You’re not one of them, are you, Daddy?
<hr>
I started to tell you about the campus( 校园 ).

I wish you’d come for a little visit and let me walk you about and say:

“That is the library. The building on your left is the gymnasium( 体育馆 ), and the one beside it is the new infirmary( 医务室 ).”

Oh, I’m good at showing visitors around.

I’ve done it all my life at the Home, and I’ve been doing it all day here.

I have, really.

And he was a Man, too!

That’s a new experience for me.

I never talked to a man before (except occasional Trustees( 董事 ), and they don’t count).

I’m sorry, Daddy, I don’t mean to hurt your feelings( 感情 ) when I say bad things about the Trustees.

I don’t feel you are really one of them.

You just ended up on the Board by chance.

The Trustee, as such, is fat and self-satisfied. He pats( 拍 ) one on the head and wears a gold watch.

That looks like a June bug( 鳃金龟 ), but is meant to be a picture of any Trustee except you.

However—to continue:

I have been walking and talking and having tea with a man.

And with a very good type of man—with Mr. Jervis Pendleton of the House of Julia.

He’s her uncle, and he’s as tall as you.

Since he was in town on business, he decided to come out to the college and call on his niece( 侄女 ).

He’s her father’s youngest brother, but she doesn’t know him very well.

It seems he took one look at her when she was a baby, decided he didn’t like her, and has never noticed her since.

Anyway, there he was, sitting in the reception( 接待 ) room, looking very proper with his hat and stick and gloves beside him.

Julia and Sallie had seventh-period classes that they couldn’t miss.

So Julia ran into my room and begged( 请求 ) me to walk him about the campus and then bring him to her when the seventh period was over.

I said I would, but not with much enthusiasm( 热情 ), because I don’t care much for Pendletons.

But he turned out to be a very sweet man.

He’s a real human being—not a Pendleton at all. We had a beautiful time; I’ve longed for an uncle ever since.

Do you mind pretending( 假装 ) you’re my uncle?

I believe they’re even better than grandmothers.

Mr. Pendleton reminded( 使....记起 ) me a little of you, Daddy, as you were twenty years ago.

You see I know you well, even if we haven’t ever met!

He’s tall and rather thin, with a funny smile that keeps wanting to come out but never quite does.

And he has a way of making you feel, from the very beginning, as though you’d known him a long time.

We walked all over the campus, after which he said he felt weak and must have some tea.

He suggested that we go to College Inn( 旅馆 )—it’s just outside the campus, by a pleasant walk through the pine( 松树 ) trees.

I said we ought to go back for Julia and Sallie.

But he said he didn’t like to have his nieces drink too much tea; it made them nervous.

So we just ran away and had tea and muffins( 松饼 ) and ice cream( 冰激凌 ) and cake at a nice little table outside.

The inn was quite conveniently( 赶巧地 ) empty, since this is the end of the month and the students have mostly spent all their money.

We had a great time!

But he had to hurry to catch his train as soon as he got back, and he hardly saw Julia at all.

She was very angry with me for taking him away.

It seems he’s an unusually rich and desirable uncle.

I was happy to find out that he is rich, because the tea and things cost sixty cents each.

This morning (It’s Monday now) three boxes of chocolates came by express mail( 特快邮件 ) for Julia and Sallie and me.

What do you think of that?

I have been given chocolates by a man!

I begin to feel like a girl instead of an Orphan( 孤儿 ).

I wish you’d come and have tea some day and let me see if I like you.

But wouldn’t it be dreadful( 糟糕的 ) if I didn’t?

However, I know I should.

Love,

Judy



June 9th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Happy day!

I’ve just finished my last examination—Physiology( 生理学 ).

And now:

Three months on a farm!

I don’t know what a farm is.

I’ve never been on one in my life.

I’ve never even looked at one (except from the car window).

But I know I’m going to love it, and I’m going to love being free.

Even now, I’m not used to being outside the John Grier Home.

Whenever I think of it, I am afraid.

I feel as though I must run faster and faster and keep looking over my shoulder, to make sure that Mrs. Lippett isn’t after me, reaching out with her arm to take me back.

I don’t have to take care of anyone this summer, do I?

Your power over me doesn’t scare( 使…害怕 ) me in the least; you are too far away to do any harm.

Mrs. Lippett is dead forever( 永远地 ), so far as I am concerned, and the people on the farm aren’t expected to supervise( 监督 ) my morals( 道德 ), are they?

No, I am sure they aren’t.

I am entirely grown up.

I leave you now to pack( 打包 ) my things away.

Yours ever,

Judy
<hr>
LOCK WILLOW( 柳树 ) FARM,

Saturday night

Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,

I’ve only just arrived and I haven’t unpacked( 打开行李 ), but I can’t wait to tell you how much I like farms.

This is a heavenly( 天堂般的 ), heavenly, )heavenly place!

The house is square like this:

And old. A hundred years or so.

It stands on the top of a hill and looks way off over miles of green fields to another line of hills.

The people on the farm are Mr. and Mrs. Semple, a hired( 被雇佣的 ) girl, and two hired men.

The hired people eat in the kitchen, and the Semples and I in the dining room.

We had ham( 火腿 ) and eggs and biscuits and honey( 蜂蜜 ) and cake and pie and tea for dinner—and there was a lot of talk as well.

I have never been so entertaining( 开心的 ) in my life; everything I say appears to be funny.

I suppose it is because I’ve never been in the country before, and I know nothing at all.

The room marked with a cross is not where the murder( 谋杀 ) was done; it’s the one I’m staying in.

It’s big and square and empty.

It has lovely old furniture( 家具 ), and windows that have to be kept open with sticks.

And a big square wooden table—I’m going to spend the summer with my elbows( 胳膊肘 ) on it, writing a novel( 小说 ).

Oh, Daddy, I’m so excited!

I can’t wait till daylight; I want to look around so much.

It’s 8.30 in the evening now, and I am about to blow out my candle and try to go to sleep.

We rise at five.

Did you ever know such fun?

I can’t believe this is really Judy.

You and the Good Lord give me more than I deserve( 应得 ).

I must try to be a very, very, very good person to deserve this.

I’m going to be. You’ll see.

Good night,

Judy

P.S. You should hear the frogs( 青蛙 ) sing, and the little pigs squeal( 尖叫 ), and you should see the new moon!

I saw it over my right shoulder.

LOCK WILLOW,

July 12th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

How did your secretary come to know about Lock Willow? (That isn’t a rhetorical( 修辞学的 ) question. I really want to know.)

Listen to this: Mr. Jervis Pendleton used to own this farm, but now he has given it to Mrs. Semple, who was his old nurse.

Did you ever hear of such a funny coincidence( 巧合 )?

She still calls him “Master( 老爷 ) Jervie” and talks about what a sweet little boy he used to be.

She has a piece of his baby hair put away in a box, and it is red—or at least reddish!

Since she discovered that I know him, I have risen very much in her opinion.

Knowing a member of the Pendleton family is the best introduction one can have at Lock Willow.

And the best of the whole family is Master Jervis—I am pleased to say that Julia belongs( 属于 ) to an inferior( 较低等的 ) branch( 分支 ).

The farm gets more and more fun.

I rode on a hay wagon( 运干草的货车 ) yesterday.

We have three big pigs and nine little piglets, and you should see them eat.

They are pigs!

We have hundreds of little baby chickens and ducks and so on.

You must be mad to live in a city when you might live on a farm.

It is my daily business to find and collect the eggs.

I fell off a beam( 梁 ) in the barn( 谷仓 ) yesterday.

I was trying to crawl( 爬行 ) over to a nest( 窝 ) that the black hen has made there.

And when I came in with a scratched( 被划破的 ) knee, Mrs. Semple bandaged( 包扎 ) it, saying, “Dear! Dear! It seems only yesterday that Master Jervie fell off that very same beam and scratched this very same knee.”

The scenery around here is perfectly beautiful.

There’s a valley( 山谷 ) and a river and a lot of wooded( 长满树的 ) hills, and far off in the distance a tall blue mountain.

We make cream( 奶油 ) twice a week.

We keep it in the spring house, which is made of stone with a stream( 小溪 ) running underneath.

Some of the farmers around here have a separator( 分离器 ), but we don’t care for these new ideas.

It may be a little harder to separate the cream by hand, but it tastes so much better.

We have six calves( 牛犊 ); and I’ve chosen the names for all of them.

1. Sylvia, because she was born in the woods.

2. Lesbia, after the Lesbia in Catullus’ poems.

3. Sallie.

4. Julia—a rather boring animal.

5. Judy, after me.

6.Daddy-Long-Legs.

You don’t mind, do you, Daddy?

He’s pure Jersey( 典型的泽西牛 ) and has a sweet character.

He looks like this—you can see how appropriate( 合适 ) the name is.

I haven’t had time yet to begin my famous novel; the farm keeps me too busy.

Yours always,

Judy

P.S. (1) I’ve learned to make doughnuts( 甜甜圈 ).

P.S. (2) I wish I could send you some of the nice, fresh butter( 黄油 ) I made yesterday. I’m a fine dairymaid( 挤奶工 )!

P.S. (3) This is a picture of Miss Jerusha Abbott, the future great author, driving home the cows.
<hr>
Sunday

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Isn’t it funny( 有趣的 )?

I started to write to you yesterday afternoon.

But as soon as I’d written the heading, “Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,” I remembered I’d promised to pick some blackberries( 黑莓 ) for dinner.

So I went off and left the paper lying on the table, and when I came back today, what do you think I found sitting in the middle of the page?

A real Daddy-Long-Legs!

I picked him up very gently, and dropped him out of the window.

I wouldn’t hurt one of them for the world.

They always remind me of you.

This is Sunday afternoon.

Amasai (hired man) in a purple tie and some bright yellow gloves, has just driven off with Carrie (hired girl).

Carrie is wearing a big hat with red roses and a blue dress, and she has curled( 弄卷 ) her hair. Amasai spent all the morning washing the carriage.

Carrie stayed home from church; she said it was to cook lunch, but really it was to iron her dress.

In two minutes more when this letter is finished, I am going to settle( 安顿 ) down to a book which I found in the attic( 阁楼 ).

It’s called “On the Trail( 小路 ),” and this is written across the front page in funny little-boy handwriting:

Jervis Pendleton

If this book should ever roam,

Box its ears and send it home.

He spent the summer here once after he had been ill, when he was about eleven years old.

He left “On the Trail” behind.

It looks well read—the marks of his dirty little hands are all over it!

Also in a corner of the attic are some of his toys.

Mrs. Semple talks so often about him that I begin to believe he really lives—not a grown man with a silk hat and walking stick, but a nice, dirty boy with uncombed( 未梳理的 ) hair

who makes too much noise when he runs up the stairs( 楼梯 ), and leaves the screen doors open, and is always asking for cookies. (And getting them, too, if I know Mrs. Semple!)

He seems to have been adventurous( 爱冒险的 ) and brave and truthful.

I’m sorry to think he is a Pendleton; he was meant for something better.

I am sorry to tell you that my favorite cow, Buttercup, has done a disgraceful( 可耻的 ) thing.

She got into the orchard( 果园 ) Friday evening and ate apples under the trees, and ate and ate until they made her completely drunk!

Did you ever hear anything so shocking( 令人震惊的 )?

Your loving orphan( 孤儿 ),

Judy Abbott

September 25th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Look at me—a Second Year student!

I came back last Friday, sorry to leave Lock Willow( 柳树 ), but glad to see the college again.

It is a pleasant feeling to come back to a place I know.

I am beginning to feel at home in college.

I am beginning, in fact, to feel at home in the world—as though I were really part of it, rather than being looked down on as a stranger.

I don’t suppose you understand in the least what I am trying to say.

A person important enough to be a Trustee( 董事 ) can’t understand the feelings( 感受 ) of a person unimportant enough to be an orphan.

And now, Daddy, listen to this.

Whom do you think I am rooming( 与...合住 ) with?

Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton.

It’s the truth. We have a study and three little bedrooms.

Sallie and I decided last spring that we should like to room together, and Julia made up her mind to stay with Sallie—I can’t imagine why, for they are not a bit alike( 相似的 ).

But the Pendletons hate change, so here we are.

Think of Jerusha Abbott, formerly of the John Grier Home for Orphans, sharing rooms with a Pendleton!

This is a democratic( 民主的 ) country.

Sallie is running for class president( 班长 ), and I believe she is going to be elected( 被选上 ).

You should see what politicians we are!

Oh, I tell you, Daddy, when we women get our rights, you men will have to work hard in order to keep yours.

I am beginning chemistry, a most unusual study.

I’ve never seen anything like it before.

Molecules( 分子 ) and atoms( 原子 ) are the raw( 未经处理的 ) material.

I hope I’ll be in a position to discuss them more next month.

I am also taking debate( 辩论 ) and logic( 逻辑 ).

Also the history of the whole world.

Also the plays of William Shakespeare.

Also French.

If this keeps up many years longer, I shall become quite intelligent( 聪明的 ).

There’s one girl in the class who talks in French as fast as she does in English.

She went abroad with her parents when she was a child, and spent three years in a French school.

You can imagine how bright she is compared with the rest of us—irregular verbs( 不规则动词 ) are just child’s play to her.

I wish my parents had left me in a French school when I was little, instead of an Orphans’ Home.

Oh no, I don’t!

Because then maybe I should never have known you.

I’d rather know you than French.

Yours in politics,

J. Abbott

October 17th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Supposing the swimming pool in the gymnasium( 体育馆 ) were filled with lemon jelly( 果酱 ), could a person trying to swim manage to keep on top or would he sink( 沉没 )?

We were eating lemon jelly when the question came up.

We discussed it for half an hour and we’re still not sure.

Sallie thinks that she could swim in it, but I am perfectly sure that the best swimmer in the world would sink.

Wouldn’t it be funny to be drowned( 被淹死 ) in lemon jelly?

Did I ever tell you about the election?

It happened three weeks ago, but it feels like ancient history already.

Sallie won, and we had a parade( 游行 ) with a band( 一群 ) of fourteen players (three harmonicas( 口琴 ) and eleven combs).

We’re very important people now in “258.”

It’s not easy living with a president.

Good night, dear Daddy.

Your Judy
<hr>
November 12th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

We beat the first-years at basketball yesterday.

Of course we’re pleased—but oh, if we could only beat the third-years!

I’d be willing to be black and blue all over and stay in bed for a week.

Sallie has invited me to spend the Christmas vacation with her.

She lives in Worcester, Massachusetts.

Wasn’t it nice of her?

I shall love to go.

I’ve never been in a private family in my life, except at Lock Willow( 柳树 ), and the Semples were grown-up and old and don’t count.

But the McBrides have a house full of children (anyway two or three) and a mother and father and grandmother, and a cat.

It’s a perfectly complete family!

Packing( 打包 ) your bags and going away is more fun than staying behind.

I am terribly excited at the idea.

Seventh period—I must run to rehearsal( 排练 ).

I’m to be in the Thanksgiving( 感恩节 ) play.

I’m going to be a prince( 王子 ) in a tower.

Doesn’t that sound like fun?

Yours,

J. A.

Saturday

Do you want to know what I look like?

Here’s a photograph of all three of us that Leonora Fenton took.

The blonde( 头发金黄的 ) one who is laughing is Sallie.

The tall one with her nose in the air is Julia.

And the little one with the hair blowing across her face is Judy—she is really more beautiful than that, but the sun was in her eyes.

“STONE GATE,”

WORCESTER, MASSACHUSSETS,

December 31st

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I meant to write to you before and thank you for the money you sent me for Christmas.

But life in the McBride house is very busy, and I don’t seem able to find two minutes to spend at a desk.

I bought a new dress—one that I didn’t need, but just wanted.

My Christmas present this year is from Daddy-Long-Legs; my family just sent love.

I’ve been having the most beautiful vacation visiting Sallie.

She lives in a big old house with the windows and doors painted white.

It is set back from the street—exactly the kind of house that I used to look at so curiously( 好奇地 ) when I was in the John Grier Home.

I never expected to see with my own eyes—but here I am! Everything is so comfortable and restful.

It is the most perfect house for children to be brought up in, with out-of-the-way corners for hide and seek( 捉迷藏 ), and open fire places for popcorn( 爆米花 ), and an attic( 阁楼 ) to play in on rainy days.

And there are slippery banisters( 滑溜溜的扶手 ) to slide( 滑 ) down, and a great big sunny kitchen.

And there’s a nice, fat, happy cook who has lived in the family for thirteen years, and always saves a piece of dough( 生面团 ) for the children to bake( 烘焙 ).

Just the sight of such a house makes you want to be a child all over again.

I never dreamed families could be so nice.

Sallie has a father and mother and grandmother, and the sweetest three-year-old baby sister with curly( 卷的 ) hair.

She has a younger brother who always forgets to wipe( 擦拭 ) his feet, and a big, good-looking brother named Jimmie, who is a student at Princeton.

We have such fun times at the table—everybody laughs and jokes and talks at once, and we don’t have to say grace( 祷告 ).

It’s a relief( 解脱 ) not having to thank Somebody for every mouthful you eat.

(Perhaps I’m ungrateful( 不感激的 ), but you’d be, too, if you were forced to offer thanks as often as I have been.)

We have done such a lot of things—I don’t know where to begin telling you about them.

Mr. McBride owns a factory, and on Christmas Eve he had a tree for the workers’ children.

Jimmie McBride was dressed as Santa Claus, and Sallie and I helped him pass out the presents.

Daddy, it was such a strange feeling!

I felt as charitable( 慷慨的 ) as a Trustee( 董事 ) of the John Grier home.

I kissed one sweet little boy—but I don’t think I patted( 轻拍 ) any of them on the head!

And two days after Christmas, they gave a dance at their own house for ME.

It was the first real dance I ever went to—college doesn’t count, because we dance with girls.

I had a new white evening dress (your Christmas present—many thanks) and long white gloves and white dancing shoes.

If only Mrs. Lippett could have seen me dancing with Jimmie McBride!

Tell her about it, please, the next time you visit the J. G. H.

Yours ever,

Judy Abbott

P.S. Would you be terribly disappointed( 失望的 ), Daddy, if I didn’t turn out to be a Great Author after all, but just a Plain( 平凡的 ) Girl?

6.30, Saturday

Dear Daddy,

We started to walk to town today, but it rained so hard!

I like winter to be winter, with snow instead of rain.

Julia’s desirable uncle called again this afternoon—and brought a five-pound box of chocolates.

There are advantages, you see, to sharing rooms with Julia.

Our girlish talk seemed to amuse( 逗...笑 ) him, and he waited for a later train in order to take tea in the study.

We had a lot of trouble getting permission( 许可 ).

It’s hard enough having fathers and grandfathers in our rooms, but uncles are a step worse.

As for brothers and cousins, they are next to impossible.

Julia had to swear( 发誓 ) that he was her uncle, and even then, I doubt if we could have had our tea if the Dean( 系主任 ) had seen how youngish and good-looking Uncle Jervis is.

Anyway, we had it, with brown bread and cheese( 奶酪 ) sandwiches.

He helped make them, and then ate four.

I told him that I had spent last summer at Lock Willow( 柳树 ).
<hr>
We talked a lot about the Semples, and the horses and cows and chickens.

All the horses that he used to know are dead, except Grover, who was a baby at the time of his last visit.

And poor Grove now is so old he can only limp( 跛行 ) about the field.

He asked if they still kept doughnuts( 甜甜圈 ) in a yellow pot( 锅 ) with a blue plate( 盘子 ) over it—and they do!

He wanted to know if there was still a woodchuck’s hole under the heap( 许多 ) of rocks—and there is!

Amasai caught a big, fat, grey one there this summer, the twenty-fifth great-grandson of the one Master( 老爷 ) Jervis caught when he was a little boy.

I called him “Master Jervie” to his face, but he didn’t appear to be insulted( 受侮辱的 ).

Julia says she has never seen him so friendly; he’s usually pretty unapproachable.

But Julia hasn’t a bit of tact( 乖巧 ), and men, I find, require a great deal.

They purr( 发出呼噜声 ) if you rub( 抚摸 ) them the right way and spit( 吐口水 ) if you don’t.

(That isn’t a very elegant metaphor( 高雅的比喻 ). I don’t mean literally( 确确实实地 ), of course)

How heavy the rain is!

We shall have to swim to chapel( 小教堂 ) tonight.

Yours ever,

Judy

Jan. 20th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Did you ever have a sweet baby girl who was stolen when she was a baby?

Maybe I am that baby girl!

If we were in a novel( 小说 ), that is how it would end, wouldn’t it?

It’s strange not to know what one is—sort of exciting and romantic( 浪漫的 ).

There are such a lot of possibilities.

Maybe I’m not American; lots of people aren’t.

I may be descended( 是...的后裔 ) from the ancient Romans( 古罗马帝国 ).

I may be a Viking’s daughter, or I may be the child of a Russian exile( 流亡者 ).

Or maybe I’m a Gipsy—I think perhaps I am.

I have a very wandering( 跳跃的 ) spirit, though I haven’t as yet had much chance to develop it.

Do you know about the time I ran away from the Home because they punished me for stealing cookies?

It’s down in the books free for any Trustee to read.

But really, Daddy, what could you expect?

They made a hungry little nine-year girl clean knives all day, with the cookie jar( 罐 ) next to her, and then went away and left her alone.

If you suddenly returned, wouldn’t you expect to find a few cookie crumbs( 碎屑 ) around her mouth?

And then they hit me on the side of the head and told all the other children that it’s because I was a thief( 贼 ).

Wouldn’t you expect me to run away?

I only ran four miles.

They caught me and brought me back; and every day for a week I was tied, like a naughty( 淘气的 ) dog, to a stick in the back yard, while the other children were allowed out to play.

Goodbye, my dear Daddy.

Judy

P.S. There’s one thing I’m perfectly sure of—I’m not Chinese.

February 4th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Jimmie McBride has sent me a Princeton banner( 旗帜 ) as wide as my room.

I am very grateful( 感激的 ) to him for remembering me, but I don’t know what on earth to do with it.

Sallie and Julia won’t let me hang it up; our room this year is furnished( 被装修 ) in red, and you can imagine how strange it would look if I added orange and black.

But it’s such nice, warm, thick cloth( 布料 ), I hate to waste it.

Would it be very wrong to have it made into a dressing gown( 礼服 )?

My old one doesn’t fit any more.

I know I’m supposed to tell you what I’ve been learning, and I haven’t.

But though you might not imagine it from my letters, my time is very much taken up with study.

It’s a very confusing( 令人困惑的 ) thing to get educated in five subjects at once.

“The test of true learning,” says the Chemistry Professor( 教授 ), “is attention to detail( 细节 ).”

“Be careful not to keep your eyes glued to detail,” says History Professor.

“Stand far enough away to get an understanding of the whole.”

You can see how carefully we have to change our methods between chemistry and history classes.

I like the historical method best.

If I say that William the Conqueror( 征服者威廉 ) came over in 1492, and Columbus discovered America in 1100 or 1066 or whenever it was, that’s a mere detail that the Professor does not care about.

It gives a feeling of security and restfulness to the history class, that is entirely lacking in chemistry.

Sixth-period bell—I must go to the laboratory and learn about chemical compounds( 化合物 ).

Examinations next week, but who’s afraid?

Yours ever,

Judy

March 5th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

There is a March wind blowing, and the sky is filled with heavy, black moving clouds.

The crows( 乌鸦 ) in the trees are making such a noise!

It’s an intoxicating( 令人陶醉的 ), exciting, calling noise.

You want to close your books and be off over the hills to race with the wind.

We had a paper chase( 撒纸追逐赛 ) last Saturday over five miles of muddy( 泥泞的 ) woods and fields.

We didn’t get back to college till half past six—half an hour late for dinner.

We went straight in to dinner without changing our clothes, and with our appetites( 食欲 ) unaffected( 不受影响的 ) by everything we had eaten!

Then none of us went to chapel—our excuse was that our boots( 靴子 ) were too dirty!

I never told you about examinations.

I passed everything easily—I know the secret now, and am never going to fail again.

I shan’t be able to graduate( 毕业 ) with honors( 荣誉 ) though, because of those Latin( 拉丁文 ) and geometry( 几何学 ) exams in my first year.

But I don’t care.

What’s the difference, as long as you’re happy?

Speaking of classics, have you ever read “Hamlet”?

If you haven’t, do it at once.

It’s great. I’ve been hearing about Shakespeare all my life, but I had no idea he really wrote so well.

I always thought he was going largely on his reputation( 名声 ).
<hr>
I have a beautiful game I like to play.

I invented it a long time ago, when I first learned to read.

I put myself to sleep every night by pretending( 假装 ) I’m a person in the book I’m reading at the moment.

At present I’m Ophelia—and such a sensible( 明智的 ) Ophelia!

I keep Hamlet happy all the time, and make him wear a scarf when he has a cold.

I’ve entirely cured( 治愈 ) him of being sad.

The King and Queen are both dead—an accident( 事故 ) at sea; no funeral( 葬礼 ) necessary—so Hamlet and I are peacefully ruling in Denmark.

We have the kingdom working beautifully.

He takes care of the governing, and I look after the charities( 慈善机构 ).

I have just created some first-class Homes for Orphans( 孤儿 ).

If you or any of the other Trustees( 董事会成员 ) would like to visit them, I shall be pleased to show you through.

I think you might find a great many helpful suggestions.

I remain, sir,

Yours most graciously( 亲切地 ),

OPHELIA,

Queen of Denmark.

March 24th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I don’t believe I can be going to Heaven( 天堂 ).

I am getting such a lot of good things here; it wouldn’t be fair to get them after I die as well.

Listen to what has happened.

Jerusha Abbott has won the short story competition (a twenty-five dollar prize) that the Monthly holds every year.

And she’s a second-year!

The competitors are mostly fourth-years.

When I saw my name posted, I couldn’t quite believe it was true.

Maybe I am going to be an author after all.

I wish Mrs. Lippett hadn’t given me such a silly name.

And Julia and Sallie and I are going to New York( 纽约 ) next Friday to do some spring shopping.

We will stay the night, and go to the theatre the next day with “Master( 大人 ) Jervie.”

He invited us.

Julia is going to stay at home with her family, but Sallie and I are going to stop at the Martha Washington Hotel.

Did you ever hear of anything so exciting?

I’ve never been in a hotel in my life, nor in a theater.

Once the local church had a festival and invited the orphans, but that wasn’t a real play and it doesn’t count.

And what do you think we’re going to see?

Hamlet. Think of that!

We studied it for four weeks in Shakespeare class and I know it by heart.

I am so excited about it all that I can hardly sleep.

Yours ever,

Judy

April 7th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Isn’t New York big? Worcester is nothing compared to it.

Do you mean to tell me that you really live there?

I was only there for two days, and I don’t believe that I shall recover( 恢复正常 ) for months.

Aren’t the streets fascinating( 迷人的 )?

And the people?

And the shops?

I never saw such lovely things as there are in the windows.

It makes you want to think about nothing but what clothes to wear.

Sallie and Julia and I went shopping together on Saturday morning.

Julia went into the fanciest( 豪华的 ) place I ever saw, white and gold walls, blue carpets( 地毯 ), blue silk curtains( 窗帘 ), and chairs painted like gold.

A perfectly beautiful lady, wearing a long black silk dress, came to meet us with a welcoming smile.

I thought we were paying a social call, and started to shake hands.

But it seemed we were only buying hats—at least Julia was.

She sat down in front of a mirror( 镜子 ) and tried on twelve, each lovelier than the last.

Then she bought the two loveliest of all.

I can’t imagine any joy( 快乐 ) in life greater than buying any hat you choose without worrying about the price!

There’s no doubt about it, Daddy;

New York would soon destroy( 摧毁 ) my modest( 谦虚的 ) character, which the John Grier Home so patiently built up.

And after we’d finished our shopping, we met Master Jervie at Sherry’s restaurant.

I suppose you’ve been to Sherry’s?

Compare that with the dining room of the John Grier Home, and you can imagine the way I felt!

I ate my fish with the wrong fork, but the waiter very kindly gave me another so that nobody noticed.

And after lunch we went to the theater.

It was wonderful, unbelievable—I dream about it every night.

Isn’t Shakespeare wonderful?

Hamlet is so much better on the stage than when we talk about it in class.

I appreciated( 感谢 ) it before, but now, dear me!

I think, if you don’t mind, that I’d rather be an actress than a writer.

Wouldn’t you like me to leave college and learn how to act?

And then I’ll send you tickets for all the plays I’m in, and smile at you in the audience( 观众 ).

Only wear a red rose, please, so I know I’m smiling at the right man.

It would be very embarrassing( 尴尬的 ) to smile at the wrong one.

We came back Saturday night and had our dinner in the train, at little tables with pink lamps( 灯 ).

I never heard of meals being served in trains before, and by mistake I said so.

“Where on earth were you brought up?” said Julia to me.

“In a village,” I replied.

“But didn’t you ever travel?”

“Not till I came to college, and then it was only a hundred and sixty miles, so we didn’t eat,” I replied.
<hr>
She’s getting quite interested in me, because I say such funny things.

I try hard not to, but they do come out when I’m surprised—and I’m surprised most of the time.

It’s a strange experience, Daddy, to pass eighteen years in the John Grier Home, and then suddenly to be thrown into the wide world outside.

But I’m getting used to it.

I don’t make such awful mistakes as I did, and I don’t feel uncomfortable any more with the other girls.

I used to hate it when people looked at me.

I felt as though they saw right through my new clothes to the Orphans( 孤儿 )’ Home dress underneath.

But I’m not letting that bother( 困扰 ) me anymore.

I have no time to regret the past—I am too busy with the present.

Master( 老爷 ) Jervie gave us each a big bunch( 束 ) of flowers.

Wasn’t that sweet of him?

I never used to care much for men—the Trustees( 董事 ) were the only ones I met—but I’m changing my mind.

Yours always,

Judy

April 10th

Dear Mr. Rich-Man,

Here’s your check for fifty dollars.

Thank you very much, but I do not feel that I can keep it.

My allowance( 零花钱 ) is enough to pay for all of the hats that I need.

I am sorry that I wrote all those silly things about the hat shop.

It’s just that I had never seen anything like it before.

However, I wasn’t begging( 祈求 )!

And I would rather not accept any more charity( 施舍 ) than I have to.

Sincerely yours( 敬上 ),

Jerusha Abbott

April 11th

Dearest Daddy,

Will you please forgive( 原谅 ) me for the letter I wrote you yesterday?

After I posted it I was sorry, and tried to get it back, but that horrible mail clerk( 可怖的邮差 ) wouldn’t give it back to me.

It’s the middle of the night now; I’ve been awake for hours thinking what a bad person I am.

I’m sorry I was so rude( 粗鲁 ) about your check.

I know you meant it kindly.

I think you’re an old dear to take so much trouble for such a silly thing as a hat.

I ought to have returned it very much more graciously( 亲切地 ).

But in any case, I had to return it.

It’s different with me than with other girls.

They can take things naturally from people.

They have fathers and brothers and aunts and uncles.

But I don’t have anyone like that.

I like to pretend( 假装 ) that you belong( 属于 ) to me, just to play with the idea, but of course I know you don’t.

I’m alone, really—with my back to the wall fighting the world—and when I think about that, I find it hard to breathe( 呼吸 ).

I put it out of my mind, and keep on pretending.

But don’t you see, Daddy, that I can’t accept any more money than I have to?

Someday I shall want to pay it back.

I’d love pretty hats and things, but I mustn’t mortgage( 抵押 ) the future to pay for them.

If I sometimes seem thoughtless and ungrateful( 不感激的 ), I never mean it.

In my heart I thank you always for the life and freedom and independence that you have given me.

It’s a quarter past two.

I’m going to go out to post this now.

You’ll receive it in the next mail( 邮件 ) after the other, so you won’t have very long to think badly of me.

Good night, Daddy,

I love you always,

Judy

May 4th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I sat up half of last night reading Jane Eyre.

Are you old enough, Daddy, to remember sixty years ago?

And, if so, did people talk that way?

It’s so exaggerated( 夸张的 ), but just the same, you read and read and read.

I can’t see how any girl could have written such a book, especially a girl who was brought up in the grounds of a church.

There’s something about those Brontes that fascinates( 迷住 ) me.

Their books, their lives, their spirit.

Where did they get it?

When I was reading about little Jane’s troubles in the charity( 慈善 ) school, I got so angry that I had to go out and take a walk.

I understood exactly how she felt.

Having known Mrs. Lippett, I could see Mr. Brocklehurst.

Don’t be angry, Daddy.

I am not saying that the John Grier Home was like the Lowood Institute( 机构 ).

We had plenty to eat and plenty to wear, enough water to wash in, and there was heat.

But there was one thing that was the same.

Nothing nice or interesting ever happened there, except ice cream( 冰激凌 ) on Sundays.

In all the eighteen years that I was there, I only had one adventure( 冒险 )—when the woodshed( 木料间 ) burned.

We had to get up in the night and dress, so as to be ready in case the house should catch on fire.

But it didn’t, and we went back to bed.

Everybody likes a few surprises; it’s a perfectly natural human desire.

But I never had one, until Mrs. Lippett called me to the office to tell me that Mr. John Smith was going to send me to college.

And then she broke the news so gradually( 逐渐地 ) that it was hardly even a surprise.
<hr>
Daddy, I think that the most necessary quality for any person to have is imagination.

It makes people able to put themselves in other people’s places.

It makes them kind and sympathetic( 有同情心的 ) and understanding.

It ought to be encouraged in children.

But the John Grier Home stamped it out at once whenever it appeared.

Duty was the one quality that was encouraged.

I don’t think children ought to know the meaning of that horrible( 恐怖的 ) word.

They ought to do everything from love.

Wait until you see the Home for Orphans( 孤儿院 ) that I am going to be the head of!

It’s my favorite game at night before I go to sleep.

I plan it out to the tiniest detail( 细节 )—the meals and clothes and study and amusements( 欢乐 ) and punishments; for even my orphans are sometimes bad.

But anyway, they are going to be happy.

I think that everyone ought to have a happy childhood to look back upon, no matter how many troubles he or she may have when grown up.

And if I ever have any children of my own, no matter how unhappy I may be, I am not going to let them have any worries until they grow up.

(There goes the chapel( 小教堂 ) bell—I’ll finish this letter later).

Saturday morning

When I came in from laboratory this afternoon, I found a squirrel( 松鼠 ) sitting on the tea table, helping himself to almonds( 杏仁 ).

These are the kind of callers we get, now that warm weather has come and the windows stay open.

I haven’t mentioned any lessons lately, but we are still having them every day.

It’s sort of a relief( 解脱 ) though, to get away from them and discuss life in general.

My discussions with you are rather one-sided, but that’s your fault( 错误 ).

You are welcome to answer back any time you choose.

I’ve been writing this letter off and on for three days, and I fear by now you must be very bored!

Goodbye, nice Mr. Man,

Judy

June 2nd

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

You will never guess the nice thing that has happened.

The McBrides have asked me to spend the summer at their camp in the Adirondacks!

They belong( 属于 ) to a sort of club on a lovely little lake in the middle of the woods.

The members have houses made of logs( 原木 ) among the trees.

They take boats out on the lake, and go on long walks to other camps.

And they have dances once a week in the club house.

Jimmie McBride is going to have a college friend visiting him part of the summer, so we shall have plenty of men to dance with.

Wasn’t it sweet of Mrs. McBride to ask me?

It seems that she liked me when I was there for Christmas.

Please excuse me for sending such a short letter.

It isn’t a real letter; it’s just to let you know my plans for the summer.

Yours happily,

Judy

June 5th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Your secretary man has just written to me, saying that Mr. Smith prefers( 偏向 ) that I should not accept Mrs. McBride’s invitation, but should return to Lock Willow( 柳树 ) the same as last summer.

Why, why, why, Daddy?

You don’t understand about it.

Mrs. McBride does want me, really and truly.

I’m not the least bit of trouble in the house.

I’m a help.

Sallie and I can do lots of useful things: it’s a good chance for me to look after a house.

Every woman ought to understand it, and I only know about Orphans’ Homes.

There aren’t any girls of our age at the camp, and Mrs. McBride wants me as a companion( 伙伴 ) for Sallie.

We are planning to do a lot of reading together.

We are going to read all of the books for next year’s English and sociology.

The Professor( 教授 ) said it would be a great help if we would get our reading finished in the summer;

and it’s so much easier to remember it if we read together and talk it over.

Just to live in the same house with Sallie’s mother is an education.

She’s the most interesting woman in the world; she knows everything.

Think how many summers I’ve spent with Mrs. Lippett, and how grateful( 感激的 ) I’ll be for the difference.

You needn’t be afraid that I’ll be crowding( 挤进 ) them.

When they have a lot of company, they just put up tents( 帐篷 ) in the woods and turn the boys outside.

It’s going to be such a nice, healthy summer exercising out of doors every minute.

Jimmie McBride is going to teach me how to ride a horse and go boating on the lake, and how to shoot and—oh, lots of things I ought to know.

It’s the kind of carefree( 无忧无虑的 ) time that I’ve never had.

I think every girl should have it once in her life.

Of course I’ll do exactly as you say, but please, please let me go, Daddy.

I’ve never wanted anything so much.

This isn’t Jerusha Abbott, the future great author, writing to you. It’s just Judy—a girl.

June 9th

Mr. John Smith,

SIR: I have received your letter, dated the 7th of this month.

According to the instructions received through your secretary, I leave next Friday to spend the summer at Lock Willow Farm.

I hope always to remain,

(Miss) Jerusha Abbott
<hr>
LOCK WILLOW( 柳树 ) FARM,

August 3rd

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

It has been nearly two months since I wrote.

It wasn’t nice of me, I know, but I haven’t loved you much this summer—you see I’m being honest!

You can’t imagine how disappointed( 失望的 ) I was at having to give up the McBrides’ camp.

Of course I know that you’re my guardian( 监护人 ), and that I have to respect your wishes.

But I couldn’t see any reason.

It was so obviously the best thing for me.

If I were you and you were me, I would have said, “Bless( 保佑 ) you my child, run along and have a good time.

See lots of new people and learn lots of new things.

Live out of doors, and get strong and well and rested for a year of hard work.”

But not at all!

Just a short note from your secretary ordering me to Lock Willow.

Even when you give me orders, you keep your distance.

That’s what hurts my feelings( 感情 ).

If you felt for me even a little bit of what I feel for you, you would sometimes send me a message that you’d written with your own hand.

Instead, I get those horrible( 可怕的 ) typed secretary’s notes.

If you gave me the slightest sign that you cared, I’d do anything on earth to please you.

I know that I was to write nice, long letters without ever expecting any answer.

You’re keeping your side of the agreement—I’m being educated—and I suppose you’re thinking I’m not keeping mine!

But, Daddy, it’s hard.

I’m so awfully lonely.

You are the only person I have to care for, and you are so shadowy( 神秘的 ).

You’re just an imaginary man that I’ve made up—and probably the real you isn’t a bit like my imaginary you.

But you did once send me a message, when I was ill.

And now, when I am feeling forgotten, I get out your card and read it again.

What I started to say, and really meant to say, was this:

My feelings are still hurt.

I don’t like to be picked up and moved about by an unreasonable, invisible( 无形的 ) Providence.

Still, when a man has been as kind and generous( 慷慨的 ) and thoughtful as you have always been to me, I suppose he has a right to be an unreasonable, invisible Providence if he chooses.

So I’ll forgive( 原谅 ) you and be cheerful again.

But I still don’t enjoy getting Sallie’s letters about the good times they are having in camp!

However—we will forget all that and begin again.

I’ve been writing a lot this summer.

I have finished four short stories, and sent them to four different magazines.

So you see I’m trying to be an author.

I have set up a study in the attic( 阁楼 ), where Master( 老爷 ) Jervie used to play.

It’s in a cool, breezy( 通风好的 ) corner with two windows, shaded( 被遮蔽 ) by a tree.

I’ll write a nicer letter in a few days, and tell you all the farm news.

We need rain.

Yours as ever,

Judy

August 10th

Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs,

SIR: I am writing to you from a fork in the tree by the pool.

I’ve been here for an hour; it’s very comfortable, especially as I’ve brought two cushions( 靠垫 ) with me.

I came up with a pen and paper, hoping to write a famous short story.

But I’ve been having problems with my heroine( 女主人公 )—I can’t make her do what I want her to do.

So I’ve left her for the moment, and am writing to you. (Not much better though, for I can’t make you do what I want, either.)

If you are in that dreadful( 糟糕的 ) New York, I wish I could send you some of this lovely fresh weather.

The country is Heaven( 天堂 ) after a week of rain.

During our week of rain I read a lot—Stevenson, mostly.

He himself is more interesting than any of the characters in his books.

I think he made himself into the hero of his own adventure( 历险 ).

Don’t you think it was perfect of him to spend all the ten thousand dollars his father left him on a sailing( 起航的 ) boat, and go sailing off to the South Seas?

He lived up to his belief in adventure.

If my father had left me ten thousand dollars, I’d do it, too.

The thought of Vailima makes me wild.

I want to see the tropics( 热带地区 ).

I want to see the whole world.

I am going to be a great author, or artist, or actress—or whatever sort of a great person I turn out to be.

I really want to travel; the very sight of a map makes me want to put on my hat and take an umbrella and start.

Our nine young pigs crossed the river and ran away last Tuesday, and only eight came back.

We don’t want to accuse( 指责 ) anyone unjustly( 不公正地 ), but we believe that Widow( 寡妇 ) Dowd has one more than she ought to have.

I have a new hat that I bought for twenty-five cents at the post office.

This is a picture of me, on my way to rake( 耙 ) the hay( 干草 ).

It’s getting too dark to see; anyway, the news is all used up.

Good night,

Judy

Friday

Good morning!

Here is some news!

What do you think?

You’d never, never, never guess who’s coming to Lock Willow.

Mr. Pendleton wrote to Mrs. Semple, saying that he’s driving through the Berkshires, and is tired and wants to rest on a nice quiet farm.

If he shows up here some night, will she have a room ready for him?

Maybe he’ll stay one week, or maybe two, or maybe three.

He’ll see how restful it is when he gets here.
<hr>
The whole house is being cleaned and all the curtains( 窗帘 ) washed.

I am driving to the Corners this morning to get two cans of brown floor paint.

Mrs. Dowd is coming tomorrow to wash the windows. (We need help, so we are forgetting about the missing pig for now.)

You might think, from all this, that the house was not already perfectly clean.

But it was!

Mrs. Semple may not know everything, but she knows how to keep a house clean.

Daddy, that’s just like a man!

He gives us no idea whether he will arrive today, or in two weeks.

We shall never be able to relax until he comes.

And if he doesn’t hurry, the cleaning may all have to be done over again.

With my hand on my heart—farewell( 再见 ).

Judy

PS. Isn’t that a nice ending?

I got it out of Stevenson’s letters.

Saturday

Good morning again!

I didn’t finish this before the postman came, so I’ll add some more.

We have one mail delivery( 送信 ) a day at twelve o’clock.

No sign yet of Master( 老爷 ) Jervie.

But you should see how clean our house is—and how carefully we wipe( 擦拭 ) our feet before we step in!

I hope he’ll come soon; I need someone to talk to.

Mrs. Semple’s world is just this single farm.

People here don’t care about the rest of the world.

It’s exactly the same as the orphans( 孤儿 ) at the John Grier Home.

Our ideas were limited( 限制 ) by the four sides of the iron fence( 栅栏 ) around us.

I didn’t mind it so much then because I was younger, and very busy.

After I’d got all my beds made and my babies’ faces washed, and had gone to school and come home and had washed their faces again, and learned my lessons in between—I was ready to go to bed.

I didn’t notice any lack of intelligent( 机智的 ) conversation.

But after two years in a conversational college, I do miss it.

I shall be glad to see somebody who speaks my language.

I really believe I’ve finished, Daddy.

I can’t think of anything else at the moment—I’ll try to write a longer letter next time.

Yours always,

Judy

PS. The lettuce( 生菜 ) hasn’t done at all well this year.

It was so dry early in the season.

August 25th

Well, Daddy, Master Jervie’s here.

And we’re having such a nice time!!

At least I am, and I think he is, too—he has been here for ten days and he doesn’t show any signs of going.

Mrs. Semple is really too good to him.

If she spoiled( 溺爱 ) him like this when he was a child, I don’t know how he ever turned out so well.

He and I eat at a little table under the trees, or—when it rains or is cold—in the sitting room.

He just decides where he wants to eat, and Carrie runs after him with the table.

Then, if she has had to carry the dishes very far, she finds a dollar under the sugar bowl.

He is a very friendly sort of man, though you might not realize it if you didn’t know him.

He looks at first sight like a true Pendleton, but he isn’t in the least.

He is just as simple and natural and sweet as he can be.

That seems a funny way to describe a man, but it’s true.

He’s very good with the farmers around here.

He meets them in a sort of man-to-man( 坦诚的 ) way.

They were very suspicious( 多疑的 ) at first.

They judged( 评判 ) him by his clothes, which are rather more city than country.

Whenever he wears something new, Mrs. Semple first admires( 称赞 ) it, then tells him to be careful not to get it dirty.

And he always says to her:

“Run along, Lizzie, and do your work.

You can’t tell me what to do any longer. I’ve grown up.”

It’s funny to think of that great big, long-legged man (nearly as long-legged as you, Daddy) ever sitting in Mrs. Semple’s lap( 大腿 ) and having his face washed.

We’re having such fun!

We’ve explored( 探究 ) the country for miles, and I’ve learned to fish with “flies” made of feathers( 羽毛 ).

Also to shoot with a gun.

Also to ride a horse—there’s still some life in old Grove.

We fed( 喂 ) him on oats( 燕麦 ) for three days, and he almost ran away with me.

Wednesday

We climbed Sky Hill on Monday afternoon.

That’s a mountain near here.

Not a very high mountain, perhaps—no snow—but at least you are out of breath( 上气不接下气 ) when you reach the top.

The lower slopes( 山坡 ) are covered with woods, but the top is just rocks.

We stayed up for the sunset( 日落 ) and built a fire and cooked our dinner.

Master Jervie did the cooking.

He said he knew how to cook outdoors better than me, and he did, too, because he’s used to camping.

We came down by moonlight, and then when we reached the wood, it was too dark to see, so Jervie pulled a flashlight( 手电筒 ) out of his pocket.

It was such fun!

He laughed and joked all the way, and talked about interesting things.

He’s read all the books I’ve ever read, and a lot of others besides.

It’s amazing( 惊人的 ) how many different things he knows.

We went for a long walk this morning, and got caught in a storm.

Our clothes were wet through before we reached home, but our spirits were not even damp( 潮湿的 ).

You should have seen Mrs. Semple’s face when we dripped( 身上滴水 ) into her kitchen.

“Oh, Master Jervie—Miss Judy! You are wet through. Dear! Dear! What shall I do? That nice new coat is perfectly ruined( 被毁掉了 ).”

She was so funny.

You would have thought that we were ten years old, and she was our mother.

I was afraid for a while that we weren’t going to get any jam( 果酱 ) for tea.
<hr>
Saturday

I started this letter ages ago, but I haven’t had a second to finish it.

Isn’t this a nice thought from Stevenson?

The world is so full of a number of things,

I am sure we should all be as happy as kings.

It’s true, you know.

The world is full of happiness, and plenty to go around, if you are only willing to take the kind that comes your way.

The whole secret is in being flexible( 灵活的 ). In the country, especially, there are such a lot of interesting things to do.

I can walk over everybody’s land, and look at everybody’s view.

I can wet my feet in any river, and enjoy it just as much as though I owned the land—with no taxes to pay!

It’s Sunday night now, about eleven o’clock. I am supposed to be getting some beauty sleep, but I had black coffee for dinner, so—no beauty sleep for me!

This morning, Mrs. Semple said to Mr. Pendleton:

“We have to leave here at a quarter past ten in order to get to church by eleven.”

“Very well, Lizzie,” said Master( 老爷 ) Jervie, “you have the carriage ready, and if I’m not dressed, just go on without waiting.”

“We’ll wait,” said she.

“As you please,” said he, “only don’t keep the horses standing too long.”

Then while she was dressing, he told Carrie to pack up( 打包 ) a lunch.

He told me to change into my walking clothes.

Then we went out through the back door and went fishing.

And poor Mrs. Semple believes that people who go fishing on Sundays go to hell!

She feels very guilty( 愧疚的 ) that she didn’t train him better when he was small and helpless, and she had the chance.

Besides—she wished to show him off in church.

Anyway, we had our fishing.

He caught four little ones, and we cooked them on a campfire( 篝火 ) for lunch.

They kept falling off our sticks into the fire, so they tasted a little of ash( 灰 ), but we ate them.

We got home at four, went driving at five, and had dinner at seven.

At ten I was sent to bed and here I am, writing to you.

I am getting a little sleepy, though.

Good night.

Ship Ahoy, Captain( 队长 ) Long-Legs!

Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum!

Guess what I’m reading?

Our conversation these past two days has been all about the sea and pirates( 海盗 ).

Isn’t Treasure Island fun?

Did you ever read it, or wasn’t it written when you were a boy?

Stevenson only got thirty pounds for the serial rights—I don’t believe it pays to be a great author.

Maybe I’ll be a school teacher.

Excuse me for filling my letters so full of Stevenson; I’m thinking about him a lot.

He is the only author in Lock Willow’s library.

I’ve been writing this letter for two weeks, and I think it’s about long enough.

Never say, Daddy, that I don’t give details( 细节 ). I wish you were here, too; we’d all have such a great time together.

I like my different friends to know each other.

I wanted to ask Mr. Pendleton if he knew you in New York( 纽约，地名 )—I should think he might.

You must move in about the same grand social circles, and you are both interested in reforms( 改革 ) and things.

But I couldn’t, because I don’t know your real name.

It’s the silliest thing I ever heard of, not to know your name.

Mrs. Lippett warned me that you were a little strange.

I should think so!

Love,

Judy

September 10th

Dear Daddy,

He has gone, and we are missing him!

When you get used to people or places or ways of living, and then have them taken away, it does leave an awfully empty feeling.

I’m finding Mrs. Semple’s conversation very plain( 平淡的 ) food.

College opens in two weeks, and I shall be glad to begin work again.

I have worked quite a lot this summer though—six short stories and seven poems.

Those I sent to the magazines all came back almost at once.

But I don’t mind. It’s good practice.

Master Jervie read them—he brought in the mail( 信件 ), so I couldn’t stop him knowing—and he said they were dreadful( 可怕的 ).

They showed that I didn’t have the slightest idea what I was talking about. (Master Jervie doesn’t let politeness interfere( 干涉 ) with truth.)

But he said the last one I did—just a little story set in college—wasn’t bad.

He had it typed, and I sent it to a magazine.

They’ve had it two weeks; maybe they’re thinking it over.

You should see the sky!

There’s the strangest orange-colored light over everything.

We’re going to have a storm.

And just as I wrote that, it started!

I had to run to close the windows.

Carrie ran up to the attic( 阁楼 ) with buckets( 桶 ), to put under the places where the roof( 屋顶 ) leaks( 渗漏 ).

Then, just as I was picking up my pen again, I remembered that I’d left a cushion( 靠垫 ) and my hat and Matthew Arnold’s poems under a tree.

So I ran out to get them; they were all very wet.

The red cover of the poems had run into the inside.

Dover Beach in the future will be washed by pink waves( 波浪 ).

A storm is awfully disturbing( 扰乱 ) in the country.

You are always having to think of so many things that are out of doors and getting spoiled( 被毁坏 ).
<hr>
Thursday

Daddy! Daddy! What do you think?

The postman has just come with two letters.

1st. My story is accepted. $50.

I’m an AUTHOR.

2nd. A letter from the college secretary.

I’m to have a scholarship( 奖学金 ) for two years that will cover board and tuition( 学费 ).

It is for “outstanding( 杰出的 ) ability in English with general excellence in other subjects.”

And I’ve won it! I applied for( 申请 ) it before I left, but I had no idea I’d get it.

It seems I’ve made up for failing Latin( 拉丁语 ) and mathematics in my first year.

I’m so glad, Daddy, because now I won’t be such a burden( 负担 ) to you.

The monthly allowance( 零用钱 ) will be all I’ll need, and maybe I can earn( 挣 ) that with writing or teaching or something.

I want so much to go back and begin work.

Yours ever,

Jerusha Abbott,

Author of “When the Second-years Won the Game.”

For sale everywhere, price ten cents.

September 26th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Back at college again and a third-year student.

Our rooms are better than ever this year—they face South, with two huge windows.

We have new wall paper and carpets( 地毯 ) and proper wooden chairs.

It’s lovely, but I don’t feel as though I belong( 属于… ) in it.

I’m always afraid I’ll get an ink spot( 墨点 ) in the wrong place.

And, Daddy, I found your letter waiting for me—pardon—I mean your secretary’s.

Will you please give me a proper reason why I shouldn’t accept that scholarship?

I don’t understand your objection in the least.

But anyway, it won’t do the slightest good for you to object.

I’ve already accepted it and I am not going to change!

That sounds a little disrespectful( 不尊敬的 ), but I don’t mean it so.

I suppose you feel that you set out to educate me, and you’d like to finish the work.

You want to put a neat( 整齐的 ) period, in the shape of a degree, at the end.

But look at it from my point of view.

I shall still owe( 欠 ) my education to you.

But I won’t be quite so much in debt( 债务 ).

I know that you don’t want me to return the money.

But I want to do it, if I possibly can.

Winning this scholarship makes it so much easier.

I was expecting to spend the rest of my life in paying you back.

Now I shall only have to spend half of the rest of it.

I hope you understand my position and won’t be angry.

I shall still most gratefully( 感激地 ) accept the allowance.

I need an allowance to live with Julia!

I wish that she had simpler tastes, or else that she were not my roommate( 室友 ).

Good night, Daddy dear, and don’t be angry because your chick( 小鸡 ) wants to scratch( 抓刨 ) for herself.

She’s growing up into a very energetic little hen—with a very determined( 坚决的 ) cluck( 咯咯叫 ) and lots of beautiful feathers( 羽毛 ) (all due to you).

Love,

Judy

September 30th

Dear Daddy,

Are you still going on about that scholarship?

I never knew a man as stubborn( 固执 ) as you.

You say that I should not be accepting favors from strangers.

Strangers!—And what are you, may I ask?

Is there anyone in the world that I know less?

I shouldn’t know you if I met you in the street.

A normal( 正常的 ) person would have written nice, cheering fatherly letters to your little Judy.

He would have come occasionally and patted( 拍 ) her on the head, and said he was glad she was such a good girl.

If you’d done that, then perhaps she wouldn’t have gone against you in your old age.

Perhaps she would have obeyed( 遵守 ) your slightest wish, like the dutiful daughter she was meant to be.

Strangers indeed!

You live in a glass house, Mr. Smith.

And besides, this isn’t a favor.

It’s like a prize—I earned it by hard work.

Also—but what’s the use of arguing with a man?

You belong, Mr. Smith, to an illogical( 不合逻辑的 ) sex.

There are just two methods to deal with a man.

One must either sweet-talk them, or be disagreeable.

I will not sweet-talk men, so I must be disagreeable.

I refuse, sir, to give up the scholarship.

If you complain( 抱怨 ) any more, I won’t accept the monthly allowance either, but will wear myself out teaching stupid first-year girls.

That is my last word on the subject!

And I have another thought.

Since you are so afraid that by taking this scholarship, I am preventing( 防止 ) someone else from getting an education, I know a way out.

You can use the money that you would have spent for me to educate some other little girl from the John Grier Home.

Don’t you think that’s a nice idea?

Only, Daddy, educate the new girl as much as you choose, but please don’t like her any better than me.

I hope that your secretary won’t be hurt, because I pay so little attention to the suggestions offered in his letter.

But I can’t help it if he is.

He’s a spoiled( 被宠坏的 ) child, Daddy.

I’ve given in to him so far, but this time I intend( 打算 ) to be firm.

Yours,

With a mind completely made up,

Jerusha Abbott

November 9th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Julia Pendleton has invited me to visit her for the Christmas holidays.

How does that strike you, Mr. Smith?

Imagine Jerusha Abbott, of the John Grier Home, sitting at the tables of the rich! I don’t know why Julia wants me—she seems to be getting quite fond of( 喜欢 ) me.

To tell the truth, I would much rather go to Sallie’s, but Julia asked me first.

So if I go anywhere, it must be to New York( 纽约，地名 ) instead of to Worcester( 伍斯特，地名 ).

The idea of meeting all the Pendletons at once scares( 使…害怕 ) me somewhat, and also I’d have to get a lot of new clothes.

So, Daddy dear, if you write that you want me to remain quietly at college, I will agree to your wishes just as sweetly and willingly as I always do.
<hr>
I’ve chosen economics this year.

When I finish that I’m going to study Charity( 慈善 ) and Reform( 改革 ).

Then, Mr. Trustee( 董事 ), I’ll know just how an Orphans( 孤儿 )’ Home ought to be run.

Don’t you think I’d make a great voter( 投票人 ) if I had my rights?

I was twenty-one last week.

This is a very wasteful country, to throw away such an honest, educated, conscientious( 勤勉认真的 ), intelligent( 聪明的 ) citizen as I would be.

Yours always,

Judy

December 7th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Thank you for letting me visit Julia—I assume( 假定 ) that your silence means you agree.

The end-of-term dance was last week.

This was the first year that any of us could go; only third- and fourth-years are allowed.

I invited Jimmie McBride, and Sallie invited his friend at Princeton, who visited them last summer at their camp.

Julia invited a man from New York( 纽约，地名 ), who is not very exciting, but socially very superior( 优越的 ).

He is connected with the Chichester family.

Perhaps that means something to you?

It doesn’t mean anything to me.

I found Jimmie a very difficult guest.

He was unhappy because he had only three dances with me.

He said he was shy about dancing with girls he didn’t know!

Anyway, our two days were great fun, and I think the men enjoyed it.

Some of them were quite nervous at first at the thought of facing one thousand girls.

But they got used to it very quickly.

Our two Princeton men had a beautiful time—at least they politely said they had, and they’ve invited us to their dance next spring.

We’ve accepted, so please don’t object, Daddy dear.

Do you want me to tell you a secret that I’ve lately discovered?

And will you promise not to think me vain( 虚荣的 )?

Then listen:

I’m pretty.

I am, really. I’d be stupid not to know it, with three mirrors( 镜子 ) in the room.

A Friend

P.S. This is one of those anonymous( 匿名的 ) letters you read about in novels.

December 20th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I only have a moment, because I need to catch the four o’clock train.

But I couldn’t go before thanking you for my Christmas box.

I love the furs( 毛皮大衣 ) and the necklace( 项链 ) and the scarf and the gloves and books—and most of all I love you!

But Daddy, you have no business to spoil( 宠坏 ) me this way.

I’m only human—and a girl.

How can I keep my mind on my studies, when you distract( 使…分心 ) me with worldly things?

I think I know now which one of the John Grier Trustees used to give the Christmas tree and the Sunday ice cream( 冰激凌 ).

He was nameless, but I know it was you!

You deserve( 值得 ) to be happy for all the good things you do.

Goodbye, and a very merry Christmas( 圣诞快乐 ).

Yours always,

Judy

January 11th

I meant to write to you from the city, Daddy, but New York kept me very busy.

I had an interesting time and I learned a lot, but I’m glad I don’t come from such a family!

I’m glad I have the John Grier Home for a background.

Whatever problems I had while I was growing up, at least there was no pretense( 虚假 ) about it.

I know now what people mean when they say they are weighed down by Things.

I didn’t draw a deep breath( 呼吸 ) until I was on a train coming back.

All the furniture( 家具 ) was beautiful, and the people I met were beautifully dressed and had perfect manners.

But I never heard one word of real talk from the time we arrived until we left.

I don’t think an idea ever entered the front door.

I only saw Master( 老爷 ) Jervie once when he called at tea time, and then I didn’t have a chance to speak to him alone.

It was really disappointing( 失望的 ) after our nice time last summer.

I don’t think he cares much for his relatives( 家人 )—and I am sure they don’t care much for him! Julia’s mother says he’s not right in the head.

He throws away his money on crazy plans to help the poor, instead of spending it on sensible( 明智的 ) things like expensive sailing boats and cars and racehorses( 赛马 ).

He does buy candy with it though!

He sent Julia and me each a box for Christmas.

I’ve seen lots of theaters( 剧院 ) and hotels and beautiful houses, but I’m glad to get back to college and my books.

I really am a student at heart.

I find this life of study much healthier than that of New York.

College is a very satisfying sort of life.

The books and study and regular( 有规律的 ) classes keep your mind awake.

Then when your mind gets tired, you have the gymnasium( 体育馆 ) and outdoor sport.

And there are always plenty of friends who are thinking about the same things as you are.

We spend a whole evening in nothing but talk, and go to bed with a very cheerful and inspired( 激动人心的 ) feeling.

We feel as though we have solved some major world problems forever( 永远地 ).

And in between, there is always such a lot of nonsense( 胡说 )—just silly jokes about the little things.

It isn’t the great big pleasures that count the most.

It’s making a great deal out of the little ones.

I’ve discovered the true secret of happiness, Daddy, and that is to live in the now.

Not to be always regretting the past, or worrying about the future; but to get the most that you can out of this moment.
<hr>
I’m going to enjoy every second, and I’m going to know I’m enjoying it while I’m enjoying it.

Most people don’t live; they just race.

They are trying to reach some distant goal( 目标 ).

And they get so breathless( 气喘吁吁的 ) that they lose all sight of the beautiful country they are passing through.

Then before they know it, they are old and worn out, and it doesn’t make any difference whether they’ve reached the goal or not.

I’ve decided to sit down by the way and have a lot of little happy moments, even if I never become a Great Author.

You see what a little philosopher( 哲学家 ) I am becoming!

Yours ever,

Judy

March 5th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

President( 校长 ) Cuyler made a speech this evening about how the modern generation is too disrespectful( 无礼的 ).

I came away from chapel( 小教堂 ) very thoughtfully.

Ought I to treat you with more dignity( 尊严 ) and seriousness, Daddy?

Yes, I’m sure I ought. But I’m afraid I probably won’t.

Yours truly,

Jerusha Abbott

April 24th

Dear Daddy,

Spring has come again!

You should see how lovely the campus( 校园 ) is.

I think you might come and look at it for yourself.

Master( 老爷 ) Jervie dropped in again last Friday—but he chose a most inconvenient( 不方便的 ) time, for Sallie and Julia and I were just running to catch a train.

And where do you think we were going?

To Princeton, to go to a dance and a ball game!

I didn’t ask you if I might go, because I had a feeling that your secretary would say no.

But it was all very proper; we had leaves of absence from college, and Mrs. McBride chaperoned( 陪伴 ) us.

We had a wonderful time—but I won’t go into details( 细节 ).

They are too many and too hard to explain.

Saturday

Up before dawn( 拂晓 )!

We walked two miles to the top of One Tree Hill to see the sunrise( 日出 ).

We had to climb up the last slope( 斜坡 ) on our hands and knees!

The sun almost beat us!

And how hungry we were when we got back!

Dear Daddy, I’m sorry, there are too many exclamation marks( 感叹号 ) on this page.

I meant to have written a lot about the new leaves on the trees and the new running track( 跑道 ), and the awful lesson we have in biology( 生物 ) tomorrow,

and the new canoes( 独木舟 ) on the lake, and my three new dresses—white and pink and blue, with a hat to match—but I am too sleepy.

I am always making this an excuse, am I not?

But a girls’ college is a busy place and we do get tired by the end of the day!

Particularly when the day begins at dawn.

Love,

Judy

May 15th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I really do love to write to you; it gives me such a respectable feeling of having some family.

Would you like me to tell you something?

You are not the only man to whom I write letters.

There are two others! I have been receiving beautiful long letters this winter from Master Jervie (with the address typed, so Julia won’t know the writing).

And every week or so a letter in very bad handwriting arrives from Princeton.

I answer them all in a quick and business-like way.

So you see, I am not so different from other girls. I get letters, too.

There goes the bell for dinner. I’ll post this as I pass the box.

Love,

J.

June 4th

Dear Daddy,

Very busy time—summer vacation starts in ten days, examinations tomorrow.

Lots of studying, lots of packing( 打包 ), and the outdoor world is so lovely that it hurts you to stay inside.

But never mind, vacation’s coming.

Julia is going abroad this summer—for the fourth time.

No doubt about it, Daddy, life is not fair.

Goodbye, Daddy.

Have a nice summer and come back in the autumn rested and ready for another year of work. (That’s what you ought to be writing to me!)

I haven’t any idea what you do in the summer, or what you do for fun.

I can’t imagine what you do.

Do you play golf( 高尔夫 ), or ride horses or just sit in the sun and relax?

Anyway, whatever it is, have a good time and don’t forget Judy.

June 10th

Dear Daddy,

This is the hardest letter I ever wrote.

But I have decided what I must do, and there isn’t going to be any turning back.

It is very sweet and generous( 慷慨的 ) of you to wish to send me to Europe this summer—for the moment I was carried away with the idea.

But my more sensible( 明智的 ) second thoughts said no.

It would be rather illogical( 不合理的 ) of me to refuse to take your money for college, and then use it instead just for amusement( 消遣 )!

You mustn’t get me used to too many luxuries( 奢侈的事 ).

One doesn’t miss what one has never had.

But it’s very hard to go without things, after one has started to think they are his or hers by natural right.

I believe that anyone can be happy no matter what their circumstances( 情况 ) are.

But living with Sallie and Julia places a great strain( 压力 ) on that philosophy( 人生哲学 ).

They have both had things from the time they were babies; they accept happiness as a matter of course.

The World, they think, owes( 亏欠 ) them everything they want.

Maybe the World does—in any case, it seems to pay up.

But as for me, it owes me nothing, and told me so clearly in the beginning.

I know these explanations seem complicated( 复杂的 ) and strange to you—but I hope you understand my meaning.

Anyway, I have a very strong feeling that the only honest thing for me to do is to teach this summer and begin to support myself.
<hr>
MAGNOLIA,

Four days later

I’d just finished writing the words above, when—what do you think happened?

Master( 老爷 ) Jervie is going abroad( 出国 ) too this summer.

Not with Julia and her family, but entirely by himself. I told him that you had invited me to go with a lady who is chaperoning( 陪伴 ) a party of girls.

He knows about you, Daddy.

That is, he knows that my father and mother are dead, and that a kind gentleman is sending me to college.

I didn’t have the courage to tell him about the John Grier Home and all the rest.

He thinks that you are my guardian( 监护人 ) and an old family friend.

I have never told him that I didn’t know you—that would seem too strange!

Anyway, he insisted( 坚持 ) on my going to Europe.

He said that it was a necessary part of my education and that I mustn’t think of refusing.

Also, he said that he would be in Paris( 巴黎，地名 ) at the same time, and we would run away from the chaperone occasionally and have dinner together at nice, funny, foreign restaurants.

Well, Daddy, it did appeal( 有吸引力 ) to me!

I almost weakened. If he hadn’t been so bossy( 专横的 ), maybe I should have entirely weakened.

I can be led on step by step, but I won’t be forced.

He said I was a silly, foolish( 愚蠢的 ), stubborn( 固执的 ) child. (Those are a few of his insults( 辱骂 ); I have forgotten the rest.)

He said that I didn’t know what was good for me, and I ought to let older people decide.

We almost quarreled( 吵架 )—in fact, I think we did!

So you see, Daddy, I am trying to avoid temptation( 诱惑 ).

Don’t be angry with me, please, and don’t think that I do not appreciate( 感激 ) your kindness.

I do—always. The only way I can ever pay you back is by turning out a Very Useful Citizen. (Are women citizens? I don’t suppose they are.)

Anyway, a Very Useful Person.

And when you look at me you can say, “I gave that Very Useful Person to the world.”

That sounds good, doesn’t it, Daddy?

But I don’t wish to mislead you.

The feeling often comes over me that I am not at all special.

It is fun to plan a career( 事业 ), but I probably shan’t turn out a bit different from any other ordinary person.

Yours ever,

Judy

August 19th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

A letter comes from Mr. Jervis Pendleton in Paris.

It’s rather a short letter.

I’m not quite forgiven( 被原谅 ) yet for refusing to follow his advice.

However, if he gets back in time, he will see me for a few days at Lock Willow( 柳树 ) before college opens.

If I am very nice and sweet and do as he says, I shall (he implies( 暗示 )) be received into favor again.

Also a letter from Sallie.

She wants me to come to their camp for two weeks in September.

Must I ask your permission( 允许 ), or may I now do as I please?

Yes, I’m sure I may—I’m a fourth-year now, you know.

I’ve worked all summer, and I deserve a little fun.

I want to see the Adirondacks; I want to see Sallie.

I want to see Sallie’s brother—he’s going to teach me to canoe( 划艇 ).

But my main reason is a nasty( 不好的 ) one.

I want Master Jervie to arrive at Lock Willow, and find me not there.

I must show him that he can’t order me around.

No one can give me orders but you, Daddy—and even you can’t always!

I’m off for the woods.

Judy

CAMP MCBRIDE,

September 6th

Dear Daddy,

Your letter didn’t come in time (I am pleased to say).

If you want me to obey( 遵守 ) your instructions, you must have your secretary send them in less than two weeks.

As you see, I am here, and have been for five days.

The woods are fine, and so is the camp, and so is the weather, and so are the McBrides, and so is the whole world.

I’m very happy!

There’s Jimmie calling for me to come canoeing.

Goodbye—sorry to have disobeyed( 违背 ) you, but why are you so determined( 坚定的 ) not to allow me to play a little?

When I’ve worked all the summer I deserve( 值得 ) two weeks.

You are being a real dog in the manger( 自己不享用又不让别人享用的人 ) about this.

However—I love you still, Daddy, even with all your faults( 错误 ).

Judy

October 3rd

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Back at college and a fourth-year!

Also editor( 编辑 ) of the Monthly.

It doesn’t seem possible, does it, that so cultured a person was an orphan( 孤儿 ) in the John Grier Home just four years ago?

We progress fast in America!

What do you think of this?

A note from Master Jervie sent to Lock Willow and forwarded here.

He’s sorry, but he finds that he can’t get up there this autumn; he has accepted an invitation to go yachting( 划艇 ) with some friends.

He hopes I’ve had a nice summer and am enjoying the country.

And he knew all the time that I was with the McBrides, for Julia told him so!

You men ought to leave these kinds of tricks( 招数 ) to women; you don’t have enough experience with them.

Yours ever,

Judy

November 17th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

My career as a writer is not progressing as fast as I had hoped.

I don’t know whether to tell you or not, but I would like some (silent) sympathy( 安慰 ), please.

Don’t reopen( 重新揭开 ) the wound by mentioning it in your next letter.

I’ve been writing a book, all last winter in the evenings and all the summer.

I just finished it before college started, and sent it to a publisher( 出版商 ).

He kept it two months, and I was certain he was going to take it.

But yesterday morning it came back, with a letter from the publisher.
<hr>
It was a very nice, fatherly letter—but frank( 直率的 )!

He said he saw from the address that I was still at college.

His advice was that I should put all of my energy into my lessons, and wait until I graduated( 毕业 ) before beginning to write.

He added his reader’s opinion.

Here it is:

“The author does not yet understand how real people talk and act.

A good deal of humor, but not always in the best of taste.

Tell her to keep on trying, and in time she may produce a real book.”

And I thought I was making a notable addition to American literature( 文学 ).

I was planning to surprise you by writing a great novel( 小说 ) before I graduated.

I collected the material for it while I was at Julia’s last Christmas.

But the editor( 编辑 ) may be right.

Probably two weeks was not long enough to understand the manners and customs( 风俗 ) of a great city.

I burned the book, and went to bed completely discouraged( 气馁的 ).

I thought I was never going to be good for anything, and that you had thrown away your money for nothing.

But what do you think?

I woke up this morning with a beautiful new book idea in my head, and I’ve been going about all day planning my characters, just as happy as I could be.

No one can ever accuse( 指责 ) me of being a pessimist( 悲观主义者 )!

If I had a husband and twelve children swallowed( 吞噬 ) by an earthquake one day, I’d get up the next morning with a smile, and start looking for another set.

Love,

Judy

December 14th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I had the strangest dream last night.

I thought I went into a book store, and there was a new book called The Life and Letters of Judy Abbott.

It was red, with a picture of the John Grier Home on the cover, and a picture of me inside with “Very truly yours, Judy Abbott,” written below.

But just as I was trying to find out whom I’m going to marry and when I’m going to die, I woke up.

Would you want to read the story of your life—written by an author who knew everything?

What if you could never forget it, but would always know what would happen next, and the exact day and time when you would die?

How many people would have the courage to read it then, and live without hope and without surprises?

Life can be boring sometimes—eat, sleep, repeat.

But imagine how much more boring it would be if nothing unexpected ever happened.

We’re studying philosophy( 哲学 ) now—interesting but hard to get hold of.

I prefer( 更喜欢 ) biology( 生物 ), where you can pin( 把…钉住 ) the subject under discussion to a board.

Do you believe in free will? I do.

I don’t agree at all with the philosophers( 哲学家 ) who think that every action is the inevitable( 不可避免的 ) result of previous( 之前的 ) causes.

I believe in my own free will and my own power to succeed—and that is the belief that moves mountains.

You watch me become a great author!

I have four chapters of my new book finished, and have rough( 大致的 ) versions of five more.

This is a very intellectual( 需要用脑力的 ) sort of letter—does your head hurt, Daddy?

I think I’ll stop now and make some candy.

I’m sorry I can’t send you a piece; it will be unusually good, for we’re going to make it with real cream( 奶油 ) and lots of butter( 黄油 ).

Love,

Judy

P.S. We’re dancing in gymnasium( 体育馆 ) class.

You can see by this picture how much we look like a real ballet( 芭蕾舞团 ).

I am the one at the end, looking so graceful( 优雅的 ).

December 26th

My Dear, Dear, Daddy,

Don’t you have any sense?

Don’t you know that you mustn’t give one girl seventeen Christmas presents?

Think how embarrassing( 尴尬的 ) it would be if we ever quarreled( 吵架 )!

I should have to hire( 租用 ) a moving van( 搬运车 ) to return your gifts.

Thank you, Daddy, a thousand times.

I think you’re the sweetest man that ever lived—and the most foolish( 愚蠢的 )!

Judy

January 9th

Do you wish to do something, Daddy, that will make sure you go to Heaven( 天堂 )?

There is a family here who are in a very bad situation.

They have four children still at home.

The two older boys have disappeared into the world to make their fortune( 发财 ), and have not sent any of it back.

The father worked in a glass factory and got sick—it’s awfully unhealthy work—and now has been sent away to a hospital.

That took all their savings, and the support of the family falls upon the oldest daughter, who is twenty-four.

She makes dresses for $1.50 a day (when she can get the work) and does embroidery( 刺绣 ) in the evening.

The mother isn’t very strong; also, she believes in God, and so refuses to do anything herself.

She sits with her hands folded( 交叉起来 ), while the daughter kills herself with overwork( 工作过度 ) and worry.

She doesn’t see how they are going to get through the rest of the winter—and I don’t either.

One hundred dollars would buy some coal and some shoes for three children so that they could go to school.

And it would leave a little over, so that she needn’t worry herself to death when a few days pass and she doesn’t get work.

You are the richest man I know.

Don’t you suppose you could spare one hundred dollars?

That girl deserves( 值得 ) help a lot more than I ever did.

I wouldn’t ask it except for the girl; I don’t care much what happens to the mother—she is such a jelly-fish.

The way people are forever( 永远 ) looking up to heaven and saying “Perhaps it’s all for the best,” when they are perfectly sure it’s not, makes me so angry.

Fatalism( 宿命论 ), or whatever you choose to call it, is simply another word for laziness.

I’m for a more active religion( 宗教信仰 )!
<hr>
Where do you think my new novel( 小说 ) is?

In the waste basket.

I can see myself that it’s no good, and when a loving author realizes that, what would the public think?

Later

I write to you, Daddy, from a bed of pain.

For two days I’ve been sick with enlarged tonsils( 扁桃体肿大 ).

I can drink hot milk with great difficulty, and that is all I can take.

“Why didn’t your parents have those tonsils out when you were a baby?” the doctor asked.

I’m sure I haven’t any idea, but I doubt if they were thinking much about me.

Yours,

J. A.

Next morning

I just read this over before sending it.

I don’t know why I write such strange, disturbing( 令人不安的 ) things.

Actually( 实际上 ) I am young and happy and full of life; and I trust you are the same.

Youth has nothing to do with birthdays, only with aliveness( 活力 ) of spirit.

So even if your hair is gray, Daddy, you can still be a boy.

Love,

Judy

Jan. 12th

Dear Kind, Generous( 慷慨的 ) Man,

Your check for my family came yesterday.

Thank you so much!

I took it down to them right after lunch, and you should have seen the girl’s face!

She was so surprised and happy that she looked almost young.

She’s only twenty-four.

Isn’t it pitiful?

Anyway, she feels now as though all the good things are coming together.

She has steady( 持续的 ) work ahead for two months—someone’s getting married, and there’s a wedding dress to make.

“Thank the good Lord!” cried the mother, when she understood the fact that that small piece of paper was one hundred dollars.

“It wasn’t the good Lord at all,” I said, “it was Daddy-Long-Legs.” (Mr. Smith, I called you.)

“But it was the good Lord who put it in his mind,” said she.

“Not at all! I put it in his mind myself,” I replied.

But anyway, Daddy, I trust the good Lord will reward( 奖励 ) you.

You deserve ten thousand years out of purgatory( 炼狱 ).

Yours most gratefully( 感激地 ),

Judy Abbott

Sunday

Feb. 15th

Just back from church—a preacher( 牧师 ) from Georgia.

We must take care, he says, not to develop our minds too much at the expense of our emotional( 感情的 ) natures.

It doesn’t matter where these preachers come from, we always get the same sermon( 布道 ).

Why don’t they go to men’s colleges and urge( 敦促 ) the students not to allow their manly natures to be ruined( 被毁灭 ) by too much thinking?

Farewell( 再见 ), kind Sir.

J. Abbott

March Fifth

Dear Mr. Trustee,

Tomorrow is the first Wednesday in the month—a weary( 疲倦的 ) day for the John Grier Home.

How happy they’ll be when five o’clock comes and you pat( 拍 ) them on the head and leave!

Did you ever pat me on the head, Daddy?

I don’t believe so—I only remember fat Trustees( 董事 ).

Give the Home my love, please.

I have quite a feeling of tenderness( 温柔 ) for it as I look back, four years later.

When I first came to college I felt quite angry because I hadn’t had a normal( 正常的 ) childhood.

But now I don’t feel that way in the least.

My childhood has given me a perspective( 观点 ) on the world that other people don’t have.

I know lots of girls (Julia, for instance) who never know that they are happy.

They are so used to the feeling that they don’t notice it.

But I am perfectly sure every moment of my life that I am happy.

And I’m going to keep on being happy, no matter what unpleasant things turn up.

I’m going to treat them (even toothaches( 牙痛 )) as interesting experiences, and be glad to know what they feel like.

However, Daddy, don’t take this love for the J.G.H. too seriously.

If I have five children, I shan’t leave them on the steps of an Orphans( 孤儿 )’ Home in order to make sure they are brought up simply.

Give my kindest regards( 问候 ) to Mrs. Lippett (that, I think, is truthful; love would be a little strong) and don’t forget to tell her what a beautiful nature I’ve developed.

Love,

Judy

LOCK WILLOW( 柳树 ),

April 4th

Dear Daddy,

Notice the address.

Sallie and I are spending Easter Vacation here.

We decided that the best thing we could do with our ten days was to find a quiet place.

We are walking over the hills and reading and writing, and having a nice, restful time.

We climbed to the top of Sky Hill this morning, where Master( 老爷 ) Jervie and I once cooked dinner.

It doesn’t seem possible that it was nearly two years ago.

I could still see the place where the smoke of our fire blackened the rock.

It is funny how certain places get connected with certain people, and you never go back without thinking of them.

I was quite lonely without him—for two minutes.

What do you think is my latest activity, Daddy?

You will begin to believe that I never learn—I am writing another book.

I started it three weeks ago and am eating it up in chunks( 大块 ).

I’ve understood the secret. Master Jervie and that editor( 编辑 ) were right; you are most convincing( 令人信服的 ) when you write about the things you know.

And this time it is about something that I do know—very well.

Guess where it’s set?

In the John Grier Home!

And it’s good, Daddy—it’s just about the tiny little things that happened every day.

I’m a realist now.

I shall go back to romance( 爱情故事 ) when my own exciting future begins.

This new book is going to get itself finished—and published( 被出版 )!

You’ll see!

If you just want a thing hard enough and keep on trying, you do get it in the end.

I’ve been trying for four years to get a letter from you—and I haven’t given up hope yet.

Goodbye, Daddy dear.

Love,

Judy
<hr>
May 17th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

This is going to be very short because my shoulder hurts at the sight of a pen.

Taking lecture( 讲座 ) notes all day, and working on my novel( 小说 ) all evening, make too much writing.

We will have our graduation ceremony( 毕业典礼 ) in three weeks from next Wednesday.

I think you might come and meet me—I shall hate you if you don’t!

Julia’s inviting Master( 老爷 ) Jervie, since he’s a relative, and Sallie’s inviting Jimmie McBride, for the same reason, but who is there for me to invite?

Just you and Lippett, and I don’t want her. Please come.

Yours, with love and aching( 疼痛的 ) fingers,

Judy

LOCK WILLOW( 柳树 ),

June 19th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I’m educated! My diploma( 毕业证书 ) is in the bottom drawer( 抽屉 ) with my two best dresses.

Thank you for your roses.

They were lovely.

Master Jervie and Jimmie both gave me roses, too, but I left theirs in water at home and carried yours at the graduation ceremony.

Here I am at Lock Willow for the summer—perhaps forever( 永远的 ).

It’s peaceful, and it’s easy to write here.

What more does an author want?

I am mad about my book.

I think of it every waking moment, and dream of it at night.

All I want is peace and quiet and lots of time to work (and good meals, of course).

I’d be expecting to have you come and visit—only I know now that that is hopeless.

When you wouldn’t come to my graduation, I tore( 扯出 ) you from my heart and buried( 埋葬 ) you forever.

Judy Abbott, Bachelor of Arts( 文科学士 )

July 24th

Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,

Isn’t it fun to work—or don’t you ever do it?

It’s especially fun when that work is the thing you’d rather do than anything else in the world.

I’ve been writing as fast as my pen would go every day this summer.

My only problem with life is that the days aren’t long enough to write all the beautiful and valuable and fun thoughts I’m thinking.

I’ve finished the second draft( 草稿 ) of my book, and am going to begin the third tomorrow morning at half past seven.

It’s the sweetest book you ever saw—it is, truly.

I think of nothing else.

I can hardly wait in the morning to dress and eat before beginning; then I write and write and write till suddenly I’m exhausted( 筋疲力尽的 ).

Then I go out with Colin (the new sheep dog) and run through the fields and get a fresh supply of ideas for the next day.

It’s the most beautiful book you ever saw—Oh, sorry—I said that before.

You don’t think that I am too proud of my work, do you, Daddy dear?

I’m not, really, only just now I’m in the enthusiastic( 狂热的 ) stage.

Maybe later on I’ll get cold and critical( 批判的 ).

No, I’m sure I won’t!

This time I’ve written a real book.

Just wait till you see it.

I still love you, Daddy dear, and I’m very happy.

With beautiful scenery all about, and lots to eat, and a comfortable bed and plenty of paper and lots of ink( 墨水 )—what more does one want in the world?

Yours as always,

Judy

PS. The postman arrives with some more news.

We are to expect Master Jervie next Friday.

He will be staying for a week.

That’s something to look forward to—only I am afraid my poor book will suffer( 受苦 ).

Master Jervie is very demanding.

August 27th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Where are you, I wonder?

I never know what part of the world you are in, but I hope you’re not in New York( 纽约，地名 ) during this awful weather.

I hope you’re on a mountaintop( 山顶 ) (but not in Switzerland( 瑞士，地名 ); somewhere nearer) looking at the snow and thinking about me.

Please be thinking about me.

I’m quite lonely and I want to be thought about.

Oh, Daddy, I wish I knew you!

Then when we were unhappy we could cheer each other up.

I don’t think I can stand much more of Lock Willow.

I’m thinking of moving.

Sallie is going to do charity( 慈善 ) work with the poor in Boston next winter.

Don’t you think it would be nice for me to go with her, and then we could get an apartment( 公寓 ) together?

I would write while she did her charity work, and we could be together in the evenings.

Evenings are very long when there’s no one but the Semples and Carrie and Amasai to talk to.

I know already that you won’t like my idea.

I can read your secretary’s letter now:

“To Miss Jerusha Abbott.

“DEAR MADAM( 女士 ),

“Mr. Smith prefers( 更愿意 ) that you remain at Lock Willow.

“Yours truly,

“ELMER H. GRIGGS.”

I hate your secretary!

But truly, Daddy, I think I shall have to go to Boston.

I can’t stay here.

If something doesn’t happen soon, I shall kill myself.

And it’s too hot here. It hasn’t rained for weeks and weeks.

This letter sounds as if I have gone crazy, but I haven’t. I just want some family.

Goodbye, my dearest Daddy.

I wish I knew you.

Judy

LOCK WILLOW,

September 19th

Dear Daddy,

Something has happened and I need advice.

I need it from you, and from nobody else in the world.

Wouldn’t it be possible for me to see you?

It’s so much easier to talk than to write; and I’m afraid your secretary might open the letter.

Judy

P.S. I’m very unhappy.

LOCK WILLOW,

October 3rd

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Your note in your own (shaky) handwriting came this morning.

I am so sorry that you have been ill.

I wouldn’t have bothered( 打扰 ) you with my problems if I had known.

Yes, I will tell you the trouble, but it’s sort of complicated( 复杂的 ) to write, and very private.

Please don’t keep this letter, but burn it.

Before I begin—here’s a check for one thousand dollars.

It seems funny, doesn’t it, for me to be sending a check to you?

Where do you think I got it?
<hr>
I’ve sold my story, Daddy.

It’s going to be published( 被出版 ) in seven parts in a magazine, and then in a book!

You might think I’d be wild with joy( 喜悦 ), but I’m not.

I don’t care.

Of course I’m glad to begin paying you—I owe( 欠 ) you over two thousand more.

It’s coming, one part at a time.

Now please don’t make any difficulties about accepting it, because it makes me happy to return it.

I owe you a great deal more than just the money.

I will continue to pay the rest of it all my life in gratitude( 感激 ) and affection( 喜爱 ).

And now, Daddy, about the other thing; please give me your advice, whether you think I’ll like it or not.

You know that I’ve always had a very special feeling towards you.

I feel that in a way you are my whole family.

But you won’t mind, will you, if I tell you that I have a very much more special feeling for another man?

You can probably guess without much trouble who he is.

My letters have been very full of Master Jervie for a very long time.

I wish I could make you understand what he is like and how good we are together.

We think the same about most things—and when we don’t, I am afraid I sometimes change my ideas to match his!

But he is almost always right.

He ought to be, since he’s fourteen years older.

In other ways, though, he’s just an overgrown boy( 大孩子 ) who needs looking after.

He doesn’t have any sense about wearing rubber boots( 橡胶靴子 ) when it rains.

He and I always think the same things are funny, and that’s important.

It’s terrible when two people’s senses of humor don’t match.

I believe there’s no way to get over that!

He is just himself, and I miss him.

The whole world seems empty without him.

I hate the moonlight because it’s beautiful and he isn’t here to see it with me.

But maybe you’ve loved somebody, too, and you know?

If you have, I don’t need to explain; if you haven’t, I can’t explain.

Anyway, that’s the way I feel—and I’ve refused to marry him.

I didn’t tell him why.

I couldn’t think of anything to say.

And now he has gone away, imagining that I want to marry Jimmie McBride.

I don’t: Jimmie isn’t grown up enough.

But Master Jervie and I had some misunderstandings, and we both hurt each other’s feelings( 感情 ).

The reason I sent him away was not because I didn’t care for him, but because I cared for him so much.

I was afraid he would regret it in the future—and I couldn’t stand that!

It didn’t seem right for a person of my background to marry into any such family as his.

I never told him about the Home, and I hated to explain that I didn’t know who I was.

I may be dreadful( 糟糕的 ), you know.

And his family are proud—and I’m proud, too!

Also, after having been educated as a writer, I owe it to you to at least try to be one.

It wouldn’t be fair to accept your education and then go off and not use it.

But now that I have sold a book and am going to be able to pay back the money, I feel that I have paid you back a little.

Besides, I suppose I could keep on being a writer even if I did marry.

It’s possible to be both a writer and a wife.

I’ve been thinking very hard about it.

He has unusual ideas.

Maybe he wouldn’t mind marrying a poor orphan( 孤儿 ) girl so much as some men might.

Perhaps when two people are always happy together and lonely when they are apart, they ought not to let anything in the world stand between them.

Of course I want to believe that!

But I’d like to get your honest, objective opinion.

You probably have a Family also, and will look at it from a worldly point of view and not just an emotional( 感情的 ), human point of view.

So you see how brave I am to lay it before you.

Suppose I go to him and explain that the trouble isn’t Jimmie, but is the John Grier Home—would that be a dreadful thing for me to do?

It would take a great deal of courage.

I’d almost rather be unhappy for the rest of my life.

This happened nearly two months ago; I haven’t heard a word from him since he left.

I was just getting sort of used to the feeling of a broken heart, when a letter came from Julia that stirred me all up( 惹我伤心 ) again.

She said—very casually—that “Uncle Jervis” had been caught out all night in a storm, and had been ill ever since with pneumonia( 肺炎 ).

And I never knew it.

I was feeling hurt because he had just disappeared without a word.

I think he’s pretty unhappy, and I know I am!

What seems to you the right thing for me to do?

Judy

October 6th

Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,

Yes, certainly I’ll come—at half past four next Wednesday afternoon.

Of course I can find the way.

I’ve been in New York( 纽约，地名 ) three times and am not quite a baby.

I can’t believe that I am really going to see you.

I’ve been just thinking about you so long that it hardly seems as though you are a real flesh-and-blood person.

You are awfully good, Daddy, to bother( 打扰 ) yourself with me, when you’re not strong.

Take care and don’t catch cold.

These fall rains are very damp( 潮湿的 ).

Love,

Judy

P. S. I’ve just had an awful thought.

Do you have a butler( 男管家 )?

I’m afraid of butlers, and if one opens the door I shall faint( 晕过去 ) upon the step.

What can I say to him?

You didn’t tell me your name.

Shall I ask for Mr. Smith?
<hr>
Thursday Morning

My very Dearest Master-Jervie-Daddy-Long-Legs-Pendleton-Smith,

Did you sleep last night? I didn’t.

I was too excited and confused( 迷惑的 ) and happy.

I don’t believe I shall ever sleep again—or eat either.

But I hope you slept.

You must, you know, because then you will get well faster.

I can’t bear to think how ill you’ve been—and all the time I never knew it.

When the doctor came down yesterday, he told me that for three days they thought you were going to die.

Oh, dearest, if that had happened, the light would have gone out of the world for me.

I suppose that someday in the far future, one of us must leave the other.

But at least we shall have had our happiness, and there will be memories( 回忆 ) to live with.

I meant to cheer you up—and instead I have to cheer myself.

For though I’m happier than I ever dreamed I could be, I’m also more serious.

The fear that something may happen rests like a shadow( 阴影 ) on my heart.

I could always be carefree( 无忧无虑的 ) before, because I had nothing important to lose.

But now—I shall have a Great Big Worry all the rest of my life.

Whenever you are away from me, I shall be thinking of all the cars that can run over you, or the signboards( 告示牌 ) that can fall on your head, or the bacteria( 细菌 ) that may be making you ill.

My peace of mind is gone forever( 永远 )—but I never cared much for just peace.

Please get well, fast! I want to have you close by where I can touch you and make sure you are real.

Such a short time we had together!

I’m afraid maybe I dreamed it.

If I were a member of your family (a very distant relative) then I could come and visit you every day.

I could read aloud and smooth out those two little wrinkles( 皱纹 ) on your forehead and make the corners of your mouth turn up in a nice cheerful smile.

But you are cheerful again, aren’t you?

You were yesterday before I left.

The doctor said I must be a good nurse, because you looked ten years younger.

I hope that being in love doesn’t make every one ten years younger.

Will you still care for me, darling( 亲爱的 ), if I turn out to be only eleven?

Yesterday was the most wonderful day that could ever happen.

If I live to be ninety-nine I shall never forget the tiniest detail( 细节 ).

The girl who left Lock Willow( 柳树 ) at dawn( 拂晓 ) was a very different person from the one who came back at night.

Mrs. Semple called me at half past four.

I started wide awake in the darkness, and the first thought that came into my head was, “I’m going to see Daddy-Long-Legs!”

I ate breakfast in the kitchen by candlelight( 烛光 ), and then drove the five miles to the station through the beautiful colors of the autumn leaves.

The sun came up on the way.

There was frost( 霜 ) on the ground, and the air was clear and cold and full of promise( 承诺 ).

I knew something was going to happen.

In the train, the rails kept singing, “You’re going to see Daddy-Long-Legs.”

It made me feel secure.

I had such faith( 信念 ) in Daddy’s ability to set things right.

And I knew that somewhere another man—dearer than Daddy—was wanting to see me.

And somehow I had a feeling that before the journey ended I should meet him, too. And I did!

When I came to the house on Madison Avenue( 麦迪逊大街 ), it looked so big and frightening that I didn’t dare( 敢于 ) to go in.

So I walked around the block to get up my courage.

But I needn’t have been a bit afraid.

Your butler( 男管家 ) is such a nice, fatherly old man that he made me feel at home at once.

“Is this Miss Abbott?” he said to me,

and I said, “Yes,” so I didn’t have to ask for Mr. Smith after all.

He told me to wait in the drawing room.

I sat down on the edge of a big old chair and kept saying to myself:

“I’m going to see Daddy-Long-Legs! I’m going to see Daddy-Long-Legs!”

Then presently the man came back and asked me please to step up to the library.

I was so excited that I could hardly walk.

Outside the door he whispered( 低声说 ),

“He’s been very ill, Miss.

This is the first day he’s been allowed to sit up.

You’ll not stay long enough to excite him?”

I knew from the way he said it that he loved you—and I think he’s an old dear!

Then he knocked and said, “Miss Abbott,” and I went in and the door closed behind me.

As I was coming in from the brightly lighted hall, it seemed so dark that for a moment I could hardly see anything.

Then I saw a big armchair( 扶手椅 ) before the fire, and a shining tea table with a smaller chair beside it.

And I realized that a man was sitting in the big chair with a rug( 毛毯 ) over his knees.

Before I could stop him, he rose—rather shakily.

He held on to the back of the chair for balance( 平衡 ), and just looked at me without a word.

And then—and then—I saw it was you!

But even then I didn’t understand.

I thought Daddy must have asked you to come.

Then you laughed and held out your hand and said,

“Dear little Judy, couldn’t you guess that I was Daddy-Long-Legs?”

Oh, how stupid I have been!

A hundred little things might have told me, if I had had any brains.

I wouldn’t make a very good detective( 侦探 ), would I, Daddy?

It was a very sweet half hour before your doctor came and sent me away.

I was so dazed( 晕眩的 ) when I got to the station that I almost took a train for St Louis.

And you were pretty dazed, too.

You forgot to give me any tea.

But we’re both very, very happy, aren’t we?

I drove back to Lock Willow in the dark but oh, how the stars were shining!

And this morning I’ve been out, visiting all the places that you and I went to together, and remembering what you said and how you looked.

The leaves are turning brown, and the air is full of frost.

I wish you were here to climb the hills with me.

I miss you, Jervie dear, but it’s a happy kind of missing; we’ll be together soon.

We belong( 属于 ) to each other now really and truly, no pretending( 假装的 ).

Doesn’t it seem strange for me to belong to someone at last?

It seems very, very sweet.

And I shall never let you be sorry for a single moment.

Yours, forever and ever,

Judy

P.S. This is the first love letter I ever wrote.

Isn’t it funny that I know how?

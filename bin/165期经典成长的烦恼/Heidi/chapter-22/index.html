                        <div><p class="text-left">The churchman’s friendly eyes shone, and with many a kind word he praised the uncle for this change.</p>
<p class="text-left">Putting his hand on Heidi’s curly( 卷卷的 ) hair, he led them out.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thus the people, who had been all talking together about this great event, could see that their churchman shook hands with the old man.</p>
<p class="text-left">They seemed very happy at the old man’s change; some of the people even accompanied( 陪伴 ) him when he walked home.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they had parted at last, the uncle looked after them with his face shining as if there was a light coming from it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi looked up to him and said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandfather, you have never looked so beautiful!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you think so, child?” he said with a smile.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You see, Heidi, I am more happy than I deserve( 应得 ). God has been good to me, to send you back.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When they arrived at Peter’s hut, the grandfather opened the door and entered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“How do you do, grandmother,” he called out.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I think we must start to mend( 修补 ) again, before the fall wind comes.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh my God, the uncle!” shouted the grandmother in joyous( 快乐的 ) surprise.</p>
<p class="text-left">“How happy I am to be able to thank you for what you have done, uncle! Thank you, God bless( 保佑 ) you for it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The next moment Peter arrived.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had a letter for Heidi, which had been given to him in the village.</p>
<p class="text-left">What an event, a letter for Heidi!</p>
<p class="text-left">They all sat down at the table while the child read it aloud.</p>
<p class="text-left">The letter was from Clara Sesemann, who wrote that everything had got so dull( 无聊的 ) since Heidi left.</p>
<p class="text-left">She said that she could not stand it very long,</p>
<p class="text-left">and therefore her father had promised to take her to the baths( 泡澡 ) at Ragatz this coming fall, which was not far from the Alp.</p>
<p class="text-left">She announced( 宣告 ) that Grandmama was coming too, for she wanted to see Heidi and her grandfather.</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandmama, having heard about the rolls( 面包卷 ), was sending some coffee, too, so that the grandmother would not have to eat them dry.</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandmama also insisted( 坚持 ) on being taken to the grandmother herself when she came on her visit.</p>
<p class="text-left">Everyone was very excited to hear that news!</p>
<p class="text-left">While Heidi and her grandfather went home, they heard the peaceful sound of evening bells.</p>
<p class="text-left">At last they reached their cottage( 乡间小屋 ), which seemed to glow( 发光 ) in the evening light.</p>
<p class="text-left">The kind doctor, who had sent Heidi home to her beloved( 心爱的 ) mountains, was approaching the Sesemann house.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a sunny day in September.</p>
<p class="text-left">His face was sad and his hair had turned very gray since spring.</p>
<p class="text-left">A few months ago, the doctor had lost his only daughter, who had lived with him since his wife’s early death.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am glad you have come, doctor,” Mr. Sesemann called to his friend as he entered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Please let us talk over this trip to Switzerland( 瑞士，地名 ) again.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you still think that Clara should not go up the Alp?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is too ill to go,” was the doctor’s answer.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann had gotten up and was walking round the room, as he always did when something was in his mind.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly he stood before his friend and said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Doctor, I have an idea. I cannot see you sad any longer.</p>
<p class="text-left">You must get away. You shall go on this trip and visit Heidi instead.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When Mr. Sesemann told Clara she couldn’t visit Heidi yet, her eyes filled with tears( 眼泪 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">But she knew that her father did not like to see her cry.</p>
<p class="text-left">Besides, she was sure that her father would only forbid( 禁止 ) her from this pleasure because it was necessary to do so.</p>
<p class="text-left">So she bravely fought her tears, and holding the doctor’s hand, said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh please, doctor, do go to see Heidi; then you can tell me all about her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Describe her grandfather to me, and Peter, with his goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">I seem to know them all so well.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then you can take all the things to her that I had planned to take myself.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The doctor answered with a smile:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Then I surely must go, Clara. You will get fat and strong, as we both want to see.</p>
<p class="text-left">Have you decided yet when I must go?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, you had better go tomorrow morning, doctor,” Clara urged( 催促 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara gave many messages to him for Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">She also told him to be sure to observe( 观察 ) everything closely.</p>
<p class="text-left">She wanted him to tell her all about it when he came back.</p>
<p class="text-left">The doctor promised to satisfy all Clara’s wishes and to start the following day.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara asked Miss Rottenmeier to pack( 打包 ) some presents.</p>
<p class="text-left">First came a heavy coat for Heidi, which Clara wanted her to use on visits to the grandmother in the winter.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then came a thick warm scarf and a large box with coffee cake for the grandmother.</p>
<p class="text-left">An enormous( 巨大的 ) sausage( 香肠 ) for Peter’s mother followed, and a little sack of( 一小麻袋 ) tobacco( 烟草 ) for the grandfather.</p>
<p class="text-left">At last a lot of mysterious( 神秘的 ) little parcels( 包裹 ) and boxes were packed, with things that Clara had gathered( 收集 ) together for Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the tidy pack lay ready on the ground, Clara’s heart filled with pleasure at the thought of her little friend’s delight( 高兴 ).</p></div>

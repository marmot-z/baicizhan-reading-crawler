<p class="text-left">When I finish that I’m going to study Charity( 慈善 ) and Reform( 改革 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Then, Mr. Trustee( 董事 ), I’ll know just how an Orphans( 孤儿 )’ Home ought to be run.</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t you think I’d make a great voter( 投票人 ) if I had my rights?</p>
<p class="text-left">I was twenty-one last week.</p>
<p class="text-left">This is a very wasteful country, to throw away such an honest, educated, conscientious( 勤勉认真的 ), intelligent( 聪明的 ) citizen as I would be.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours always,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">December 7th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Thank you for letting me visit Julia—I assume( 假定 ) that your silence means you agree.</p>
<p class="text-left">The end-of-term dance was last week.</p>
<p class="text-left">This was the first year that any of us could go; only third- and fourth-years are allowed.</p>
<p class="text-left">I invited Jimmie McBride, and Sallie invited his friend at Princeton, who visited them last summer at their camp.</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia invited a man from New York( 纽约，地名 ), who is not very exciting, but socially very superior( 优越的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He is connected with the Chichester family.</p>
<p class="text-left">Perhaps that means something to you?</p>
<p class="text-left">It doesn’t mean anything to me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I found Jimmie a very difficult guest.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was unhappy because he had only three dances with me.</p>
<p class="text-left">He said he was shy about dancing with girls he didn’t know!</p>
<p class="text-left">Anyway, our two days were great fun, and I think the men enjoyed it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Some of them were quite nervous at first at the thought of facing one thousand girls.</p>
<p class="text-left">But they got used to it very quickly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Our two Princeton men had a beautiful time—at least they politely said they had, and they’ve invited us to their dance next spring.</p>
<p class="text-left">We’ve accepted, so please don’t object, Daddy dear.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you want me to tell you a secret that I’ve lately discovered?</p>
<p class="text-left">And will you promise not to think me vain( 虚荣的 )?</p>
<p class="text-left">Then listen:</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m pretty.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am, really. I’d be stupid not to know it, with three mirrors( 镜子 ) in the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">A Friend</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S. This is one of those anonymous( 匿名的 ) letters you read about in novels.</p>
<p class="text-left">December 20th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">I only have a moment, because I need to catch the four o’clock train.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I couldn’t go before thanking you for my Christmas box.</p>
<p class="text-left">I love the furs( 毛皮大衣 ) and the necklace( 项链 ) and the scarf and the gloves and books—and most of all I love you!</p>
<p class="text-left">But Daddy, you have no business to spoil( 宠坏 ) me this way.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m only human—and a girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">How can I keep my mind on my studies, when you distract( 使…分心 ) me with worldly things?</p>
<p class="text-left">I think I know now which one of the John Grier Trustees used to give the Christmas tree and the Sunday ice cream( 冰激凌 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He was nameless, but I know it was you!</p>
<p class="text-left">You deserve( 值得 ) to be happy for all the good things you do.</p>
<p class="text-left">Goodbye, and a very merry Christmas( 圣诞快乐 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours always,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">January 11th</p>
<p class="text-left">I meant to write to you from the city, Daddy, but New York kept me very busy.</p>
<p class="text-left">I had an interesting time and I learned a lot, but I’m glad I don’t come from such a family!</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m glad I have the John Grier Home for a background.</p>
<p class="text-left">Whatever problems I had while I was growing up, at least there was no pretense( 虚假 ) about it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I know now what people mean when they say they are weighed down by Things.</p>
<p class="text-left">I didn’t draw a deep breath( 呼吸 ) until I was on a train coming back.</p>
<p class="text-left">All the furniture( 家具 ) was beautiful, and the people I met were beautifully dressed and had perfect manners.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I never heard one word of real talk from the time we arrived until we left.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t think an idea ever entered the front door.</p>
<p class="text-left">I only saw Master( 老爷 ) Jervie once when he called at tea time, and then I didn’t have a chance to speak to him alone.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was really disappointing( 失望的 ) after our nice time last summer.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t think he cares much for his relatives( 家人 )—and I am sure they don’t care much for him! Julia’s mother says he’s not right in the head.</p>
<p class="text-left">He throws away his money on crazy plans to help the poor, instead of spending it on sensible( 明智的 ) things like expensive sailing boats and cars and racehorses( 赛马 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He does buy candy with it though!</p>
<p class="text-left">He sent Julia and me each a box for Christmas.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve seen lots of theaters( 剧院 ) and hotels and beautiful houses, but I’m glad to get back to college and my books.</p>
<p class="text-left">I really am a student at heart.</p>
<p class="text-left">I find this life of study much healthier than that of New York.</p>
<p class="text-left">College is a very satisfying sort of life.</p>
<p class="text-left">The books and study and regular( 有规律的 ) classes keep your mind awake.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then when your mind gets tired, you have the gymnasium( 体育馆 ) and outdoor sport.</p>
<p class="text-left">And there are always plenty of friends who are thinking about the same things as you are.</p>
<p class="text-left">We spend a whole evening in nothing but talk, and go to bed with a very cheerful and inspired( 激动人心的 ) feeling.</p>
<p class="text-left">We feel as though we have solved some major world problems forever( 永远地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">And in between, there is always such a lot of nonsense( 胡说 )—just silly jokes about the little things.</p>
<p class="text-left">It isn’t the great big pleasures that count the most.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s making a great deal out of the little ones.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve discovered the true secret of happiness, Daddy, and that is to live in the now.</p>
<p class="text-left">Not to be always regretting the past, or worrying about the future; but to get the most that you can out of this moment.</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">If Sara had been a different kind of child, the life she led at Miss Minchin’s Select School for the next few years would have been bad for her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was treated more as if she were a special guest than as if she were a mere little girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">If she had been a spoiled child, she might have become unbearable to others through being treated so nicely.</p>
<p class="text-left">Privately Miss Minchin disliked her, but she would not do anything which might make such a desirable( 合意的 ) pupil wish to leave her school.</p>
<p class="text-left">She knew quite well that if Sara wrote to her papa to tell him she was unhappy, Captain Crewe would take her away at once.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin’s opinion was that if a child were continually praised and always did what she liked, she would be sure to be fond of the place where she was treated so.</p>
<p class="text-left">Accordingly, Sara was praised for her quickness at her lessons, for her good manners, and for her generosity if she gave sixpence( 六便士 ) to a beggar.</p>
<p class="text-left">If she had not had a clever little brain, she might have been a very self-satisfied young person.</p>
<p class="text-left">But the clever little brain told her a great many wise things about her situation.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now and then she talked these things over to Ermengarde.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Things happen to people by accident,” she used to say.</p>
<p class="text-left">“A lot of nice accidents have happened to me.</p>
<p class="text-left">It just happened that I was born with a father who was nice, and could give me everything I liked.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you have everything you want and everyone is kind to you, how can you help but be well-mannered?</p>
<p class="text-left">Perhaps I’m a terrible child, and no one will ever know, just because I never have any problems.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Lavinia has no problems,” said Ermengarde, “and she is terrible enough.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Lavinia, in fact, was jealous( 嫉妒的 ) of Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">Until the new pupil’s arrival, she had felt herself the leader in the school.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had led because she could make herself extremely disagreeable if the others did not follow her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was rather pretty, and had been the best-dressed pupil in the Select School until Sara appeared.</p>
<p class="text-left">This, at the beginning, had been bad enough.</p>
<p class="text-left">As time went on, however, it became clear that Sara was a leader, too, and not because she could make herself disagreeable, but because she never did.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There’s one thing about Sara Crewe,” Jessie had once angered her “best friend” by saying honestly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She’s never ‘grand’ about herself the least bit, and you know she might be, Lavvie.</p>
<p class="text-left">I believe I couldn’t help being grand—just a little—if I had so many fine things and people paid such attention to me.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s sickening, the way Miss Minchin shows her off when parents come.”</p>
<p class="text-left">It was quite true that Sara was never “grand.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She was a friendly little soul, and shared her belongings with a free hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was a motherly young person, and when people fell down and hurt their knees, she helped them up and comforted them.</p>
<p class="text-left">So the younger children loved Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">Lottie Legh especially looked up to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Lottie had been sent to school by a rather young papa who could not imagine what else to do with her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her young mother had died, and the child had always been treated like a very spoiled pet.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was a very difficult little girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she wanted anything or did not want anything she cried and shouted.</p>
<p class="text-left">Lottie had found out that a very small girl who had lost her mother was a person who ought to be pitied.</p>
<p class="text-left">This became her strongest weapon( 武器 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">She had probably heard some grown-up people talking her over in the early days, after her mother’s death.</p>
<p class="text-left">So it became her habit to make great use of this knowledge.</p>
<p class="text-left">One morning when passing a sitting room, Sara heard both Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia trying to stop Lottie’s angry cries.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What is she crying for?” Miss Minchin yelled( 大叫 ) over her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh—oh—oh!” Sara heard. “I don’t have any mam—ma-a!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Lottie!” screamed Miss Amelia.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do stop, darling! Don’t cry! Please don’t!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“She ought to be whipped( 被鞭打 ),” Miss Minchin said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You shall be whipped, you awful child!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Lottie cried more loudly than ever.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Amelia began to cry.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin’s voice rose until it almost thundered.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then suddenly she sprang up from her chair and left the room, leaving Miss Amelia to fix the matter.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara had paused in the hall, wondering if she should go into the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had recently begun to be friendly with Lottie and might be able to quiet her.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Miss Minchin came out and saw her, she looked rather annoyed.</p>
<p class="text-left">She realized that her voice, as heard from inside the room, could not have sounded respectable.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Sara!” she said, trying to smile.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I stopped,” explained Sara, “because I knew it was Lottie—and I thought, perhaps—just perhaps, I could make her be quiet. May I try, Miss Minchin?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“If you can, you are a clever child,” answered Miss Minchin, drawing in her mouth coldly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I suppose you can manage her. Go in.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And she left her.</p></div>

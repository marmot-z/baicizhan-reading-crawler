                        <div><p class="text-left">It was an early morning in the mountains and a fresh wind rocked the old fir( 冷杉 ) trees to and fro.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi opened her eyes, for the sound of the wind had awakened her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Coming down the little ladder( 阶梯 ) and finding the grandfather’s bed empty, she ran outside.</p>
<p class="text-left">The old man was looking up at the sky to see what the weather was going to be like that day.</p>
<p class="text-left">Rosy clouds were passing overhead( 在头顶上 ), but gradually( 渐渐地 ) the sky grew more blue and deep.</p>
<p class="text-left">Soon a golden light passed over the heights, for the sun was rising.</p>
<p class="text-left">After the old man had washed and milked the goats( 山羊 ), he brought them out of the shed( 棚子 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">When Heidi saw her friends again, she touched them tenderly( 温柔地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Soon Peter arrived with the other goats, with the happy Thistlefinch ahead of all the others.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was soon in the middle of them, and was pushed about among them.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter was anxious( 心急地 ) to say a word to the little girl, so he gave a high whistle( 哨声 ), urging( 催促 ) the goats to climb ahead.</p>
<p class="text-left">When he was near her, he said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“You really might come with me today!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No, I can’t, Peter,” said Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">“They might come from Frankfurt at any time. I must be home when they come.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“How often you have said that,” said the boy with anger in his voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he turned about and led his goats up the mountain.</p>
<p class="text-left">Since Heidi had come home again to her grandfather, she did many things that never occurred to( 想起 ) her before.</p>
<p class="text-left">For instance, she would make her bed every morning, and run about the hut, tidying and cleaning.</p>
<p class="text-left">After breakfast, Heidi began the task she had given to herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">On this day it took her longer than usual, for the weather was too glorious( 美好的 ) to stay inside.</p>
<p class="text-left">Over and over again the bright sun would tempt( 引诱 ) the busy child outside.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather had been busy in his little workshop( 工作间 ), merely glancing( 看一眼 ) over at the child from time to time.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly he heard her call:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh grandfather, come!”</p>
<p class="text-left">He was frightened( 感到害怕的 ) and came out quickly.</p>
<p class="text-left">He saw her running down the hill crying:</p>
<p class="text-left">“They are coming, they are coming. Oh, the doctor is coming first.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When Heidi at last reached her old friend, he held out his hand, which Heidi immediately seized( 抓住 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">In the full joy( 欢乐 ) of her heart, she shouted out:</p>
<p class="text-left">“How do you do, doctor? And I thank you a thousand times!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“How are you, Heidi? But what are you thanking me for?” the doctor asked, with a smile.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Because you let me come home again,” the child explained.</p>
<p class="text-left">The gentleman’s face lit up like sunshine.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had certainly not expected to be received in that way on the Alp.</p>
<p class="text-left">On the contrary( 相反 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">Not even noticing all the beauty around him, he had climbed up sadly,</p>
<p class="text-left">for he was sure that Heidi probably would not know him anymore.</p>
<p class="text-left">Instead, he saw Heidi’s bright eyes looking up at him in gratefulness( 感激 ) and love.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come now, Heidi! Take me to your grandfather, for I want to see where you live.”</p>
<p class="text-left">He had taken her hand like a kind father, but Heidi stood still and looked down the mountain side.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But where are Clara and grandmama?” she asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Child, I must tell you something now which will make you sad, and it makes me just as sad,” replied the doctor.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I had to come alone, for Clara has been very ill and could not travel.</p>
<p class="text-left">Of course grandmama has not come either;</p>
<p class="text-left">but the spring will soon be here, and when the days get long and warm, they will surely visit you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was perfectly amazed( 惊讶的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">She could not understand how all those things that she had pictured to herself so clearly would not happen after all.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was some time before Heidi remembered that, after all, she had come down to meet the doctor.</p>
<p class="text-left">Looking up at her friend, she was struck by his sad and cheerless face.</p>
<p class="text-left">How changed he was since she had seen him!</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not like to see people unhappy, especially the good, kind doctor.</p>
<p class="text-left">He must be sad because Clara and grandmama had not come.</p>
<p class="text-left">To make him feel better, she said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, it won’t last long till spring comes again; then they will come for sure;</p>
<p class="text-left">they’ll be able to stay much longer then, and that will please Clara.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now we’ll go to grandfather.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Hand in hand they walked together to the cottage( 乡间小屋 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">When they reached it, she called out to her grandfather quite happily:</p>
<p class="text-left">“They are not here yet, but it won’t be very long before they are coming!”</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather warmly welcomed his guest.</p>
<p class="text-left">They all sat down on the bench( 长凳 ) before the door, and the doctor told them the reason of his visit.</p>
<p class="text-left">He whispered( 低声说 ) to the child that something was coming up the mountain very soon which would bring her more pleasure than his visit.</p>
<p class="text-left">What could it be?</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle advised the doctor to spend the splendid( 美妙的 ) days of autumn on the Alp.</p>
<p class="text-left">He suggested that the doctor would take a little room in the village instead of in Ragatz.</p>
<p class="text-left">From there he could easily walk up every day to the hut, and from there the uncle could take him all around the mountains.</p>
<p class="text-left">This plan was accepted.</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">“Here we are, Sara,” said Captain Crewe, making his voice sound cheerful.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he lifted her out of the cab and they went up the steps and rang the bell.</p>
<p class="text-left">The drawing room into which they entered was covered by a carpet( 地毯 ) with a square pattern( 图案 ) upon it.</p>
<p class="text-left">The chairs were square, and a heavy marble( 大理石的 ) clock stood upon the heavy marble mantel( 壁炉架 ) above the fireplace.</p>
<p class="text-left">As she sat down in one of the stiff( 硬邦邦的 ) wooden chairs, Sara cast a quick look about her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t like it, papa,” she said. “But then I would say soldiers—even brave ones—don’t really like going into battle.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Captain Crewe laughed at this.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was young and full of fun, and he was never tired of hearing Sara’s strange speeches.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, little Sara,” he said, “what shall I do when I have no one to say serious things to me? No one else is as serious as you are.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But why do serious things make you laugh so?” asked Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Because you are such fun when you say them,” he answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly he swept her into his arms and kissed her very hard.</p>
<p class="text-left">But then he stopped laughing all at once and looked almost as if tears had come into his eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was just then that Miss Minchin entered the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was very like her house, Sara felt: tall and boring, respectable and ugly.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had cold, fishy( 呆滞的 ) eyes, and a cold, fishy smile.</p>
<p class="text-left">It spread itself into a large smile when she saw Sara and Captain Crewe.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had heard that he was a rich father who was willing to spend a great deal of money on his little daughter.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It will be a great privilege( 荣幸 ) to have charge of such a beautiful and promising( 前途无量的 ) child, Captain Crewe,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">She took Sara’s hand and stroked( 轻抚 ) it.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Lady Meredith has told me of her unusual cleverness.</p>
<p class="text-left">A clever child is a great treasure in a school like mine.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara stood quietly, with her eyes fixed upon Miss Minchin’s face.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was thinking something strange, as usual.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why does she say I am a beautiful child?” she was thinking.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am not beautiful at all.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have short black hair and green eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am one of the ugliest children I ever saw.</p>
<p class="text-left">She is beginning by telling a lie.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She was mistaken, however, in thinking she was an ugly child.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had an unusual charm( 魅力 ) of her own.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was a small child, but rather tall for her age, and had an intense( 热情的 ), attractive little face.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her hair was heavy and black; her eyes were greenish gray, it is true, but they were big, wonderful eyes with long, black eyelashes( 睫毛 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Still she was very firm in her belief that she was an ugly little girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was not at all pleased by Miss Minchin’s praise.</p>
<p class="text-left">After she had known Miss Minchin longer, Sara discovered that she said the same thing to each father and mother who brought a child to her school.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara stood near her father and listened while he and Miss Minchin talked.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had been brought to the school because Lady Meredith’s two little girls had been educated there.</p>
<p class="text-left">Captain Crewe had a great respect for Lady Meredith’s experience.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara was to be what was known as “a parlor boarder( 特别寄宿生 ),” and she was to enjoy even greater privileges than parlor boarders usually did.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was to have a pretty bedroom and sitting room of her own; she was to have a pony( 小马驹 ) and a carriage( 马车 ), and a maid( 女仆 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am not worried about her education,” Captain Crewe said, as he held Sara’s hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The difficulty will be to keep her from learning too fast and too much.</p>
<p class="text-left">She is always sitting with her little nose in books.</p>
<p class="text-left">She is always starving for( 渴望 ) new books.</p>
<p class="text-left">She wants great, big grown-up books—French and German as well as English—history, poetry, and all sorts of things.</p>
<p class="text-left">Drag her away from her books when she reads too much.</p>
<p class="text-left">Make her ride her pony or go out and buy a new doll.</p>
<p class="text-left">She ought to play more with dolls.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Papa,” said Sara, “if I went out and bought a new doll every few days, I should have more than I could be fond of.</p>
<p class="text-left">Dolls ought to be close friends. Emily is going to be my close friend.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Who is Emily?” Miss Minchin asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Tell her, Sara,” Captain Crewe said, smiling.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is a doll that papa is going to buy for me,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“We are going out together to find her.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have called her Emily.</p>
<p class="text-left">She is going to be my friend when papa is gone.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin’s large, fishy smile grew even more.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What an original child!” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What a darling little creature!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” said Captain Crewe, drawing Sara close.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is a darling little creature.</p>
<p class="text-left">Take great care of her for me, Miss Minchin.”</p></div>

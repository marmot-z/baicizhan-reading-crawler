                        <div><p class="text-left">Heidi had approached the bed, asking anxiously( 焦急地 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are you very sick, grandmother?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No, no, child,” the old woman told her,</p>
<p class="text-left">“but the frost( 霜 ) has gone into my body a little.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But, grandmother, your bed is lower at your head’s side, where it ought to be high.</p>
<p class="text-left">No bed ought to be like that.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I know, child, I can feel it well.” So saying,</p>
<p class="text-left">the old woman tried to change her position on the pillow( 枕头 ) that lay under her like a thin board.</p>
<p class="text-left">“My pillow never was very thick, and sleeping on it all these years has made it flat.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh dear, if I had only asked Clara to give me the bed I had in Frankfurt!” Heidi said sadly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It had three big pillows on it;</p>
<p class="text-left">I could hardly sleep because I kept sliding( 滑 ) down from them all the time.</p>
<p class="text-left">Could you sleep with them, grandmother?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Of course, because that would keep me warm.</p>
<p class="text-left">I could breathe( 呼吸 ) so much easier, too,” said the grandmother, trying to find a higher place to lie on.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But I must not talk about it anymore, for I have to be thankful for many things.</p>
<p class="text-left">I get the lovely roll( 面包卷 ) every day and have this beautiful warm scarf.</p>
<p class="text-left">I also have you, my child!</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi, wouldn’t you like to read me something today?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi immediately fetched( 拿 ) the book and read one song after another.</p>
<p class="text-left">While she was reading, the grandmother was lying with folded( 交叠的 ) hands.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her face, which had been so sad a short time ago, was lit up with a happy smile.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she had finished reading, the child said good night.</p>
<p class="text-left">Pulling Peter with her, she ran outside.</p>
<p class="text-left">The bright moon was shining down on the white snow, light as day.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter had prepared a sled( 雪橇 ) to take Heidi home.</p>
<p class="text-left">The two children were already flying down the Alp, like birds flying through the air.</p>
<p class="text-left">After Heidi had gone to bed that night, she lay awake a little while, thinking over everything the grandmother had said.</p>
<p class="text-left">If only poor grandmother could hear those comforting words every day!</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly Heidi had an idea.</p>
<p class="text-left">It excited her so much that she could hardly wait till morning came to start with her plan.</p>
<p class="text-left">But in her excitement she had forgotten her evening prayer( 祷告词 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">So, sitting up in bed, she prayed( 祈祷 ) to God.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then, falling back into the fragrant( 芳香的 ) hay( 干草 ), she soon slept peacefully and soundly( 酣甜地 ) till the bright morning came.</p>
<p class="text-left">The next evening, Peter paid a visit to Heidi, as usual.</p>
<p class="text-left">The minute he opened the door she ran up to him, saying,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Peter, I have to tell you something.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Say it,” he replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You must learn to read now,” said the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have done it already.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, yes, Peter, but I don’t mean it that way,” Heidi went on.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You must learn so that you really know how to read later.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I can’t,” Peter remarked( 说 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’ll teach you, for I know how;</p>
<p class="text-left">when you have learnt it, you must read one or two songs to grandmother every day.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I shan’t!” answered the boy.</p>
<p class="text-left">This refusal made Heidi very angry.</p>
<p class="text-left">With flaming( 发火的 ) eyes, she planted( 站定 ) herself before the boy and said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’ll tell you what will happen, if you don’t want to learn.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your mother has often said that she’ll send you to Frankfurt.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara showed me the terrible, large boys’ school there, where you’ll have to go.</p>
<p class="text-left">There are whole rows of teachers there, and when they are out walking they have high black hats on their heads.</p>
<p class="text-left">I saw them myself, when I was in Frankfurt!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Cold shivers( 冷颤 ) ran down Peter’s back.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, you’ll have to go there,</p>
<p class="text-left">and when they find out that you can’t read or even spell, they’ll laugh at you!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’ll do it,” said Peter, half angry and half frightened( 害怕的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, I am glad. Let us start right away!” said Heidi joyfully( 高兴地 ), pulling Peter over to the table.</p>
<p class="text-left">Among the things that Clara had sent, Heidi had found a little book with the A, B, C and some rhymes( 押韵 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">She had chosen this for the lessons.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter had great difficulty spelling the first rhyme.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’ll read it to you, and then you’ll be able to do it better.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then Heidi began to read the letter rhymes to Peter, who learned them unwillingly but quickly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thus the days passed by.</p>
<p class="text-left">In all this time Peter had really made some progress, though the rhymes still gave him difficulty.</p>
<p class="text-left">Before it was time to go, Peter knew the last letter, and had even begun to read short words.</p>
<p class="text-left">From this day on he progressed more quickly.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was three weeks since Heidi had paid her last visit to the grandmother, for much snow had fallen since.</p>
<p class="text-left">One evening, Peter, coming home, said happily:</p>
<p class="text-left">“I can do it!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“What is it you can do, Peter?” asked his mother, eagerly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Read.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“What, is it possible? Did you hear it, grandmother?” said Brigida.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmother also was curious( 好奇的 ) how this had happened.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I must read a song now; Heidi told me to,” Peter continued.</p>
<p class="text-left">To the women’s great surprise, Peter began.</p>
<p class="text-left">After every sentence his mother would shout,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Who would have ever thought it!” while the grandmother remained silent.</p></div>

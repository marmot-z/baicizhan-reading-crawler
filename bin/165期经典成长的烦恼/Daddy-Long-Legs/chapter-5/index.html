                        <div><p class="text-left">Wednesday</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve changed my name.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m still “Jerusha” officially for the school, but I’m “Judy” everywhere else.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s really too bad, isn’t it, to have to give yourself the only nickname( 昵称 ) you ever had?</p>
<p class="text-left">I didn’t quite make up the Judy though.</p>
<p class="text-left">That’s what Freddy Perkins used to call me before he could talk properly.</p>
<p class="text-left">I wish Mrs. Lippett would put a little more thought into choosing babies’ names.</p>
<p class="text-left">She gets the last names out of the telephone book—you’ll find Abbott on the first page—and she picks the first names up anywhere.</p>
<p class="text-left">She got Jerusha from a tombstone( 墓碑 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve always hated it; but I rather like Judy.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s such a silly name. It sounds like exactly the kind of girl I’m not—a sweet little blue-eyed thing, loved and petted by all the family, who goes happily through life without any cares.</p>
<p class="text-left">Wouldn’t it be nice to be like that?</p>
<p class="text-left">Whatever faults I may have, no one can ever say that I’ve been spoiled( 被宠坏的 ) by my family!</p>
<p class="text-left">But it’s great fun to pretend( 假装 ) I have been. In the future please always call me Judy.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you want to know something?</p>
<p class="text-left">I have three pairs of gloves.</p>
<p class="text-left">These are the first gloves I’ve ever had that have five fingers.</p>
<p class="text-left">(Dinner bell. Goodbye.)</p>
<p class="text-left">Friday</p>
<p class="text-left">Can you believe this, Daddy?</p>
<p class="text-left">The English instructor said that my last paper showed a lot of originality.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did, truly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Those were her words.</p>
<p class="text-left">It doesn’t seem possible, does it, considering the eighteen years of training that I’ve had?</p>
<p class="text-left">The aim( 目的 ) of the John Grier Home (which you probably know and agree with) is to turn the ninety-seven orphans( 孤儿 ) into ninety-seven exact copies of each other.</p>
<p class="text-left">My unusual artistic ability was developed at an early age by drawing chalk( 粉笔的 ) pictures of Mrs. Lippett.</p>
<p class="text-left">I hope that I don’t hurt your feelings when I criticize( 批评 ) the home of my youth?</p>
<p class="text-left">But you have the advantage, you know, for if I say something you really don’t like, you can always stop paying.</p>
<p class="text-left">That isn’t a very polite thing to say—but you can’t expect me to have any manners.</p>
<p class="text-left">A home for orphans isn’t a young ladies’ finishing school.</p>
<p class="text-left">You know, Daddy, it isn’t the work that is going to be hard in college.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s the play.</p>
<p class="text-left">Half the time I don’t know what the girls are talking about.</p>
<p class="text-left">Their jokes seem to be about a past that everyone but me has shared.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m a foreigner in their world, and I don’t understand the language.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s a miserable( 痛苦的 ) feeling.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve had it all my life.</p>
<p class="text-left">At the high school the girls would stand in groups and just look at me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was strange and different, and everybody knew it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I could feel “John Grier Home” written on my face.</p>
<p class="text-left">And then some of them would make an effort to be polite.</p>
<p class="text-left">I hated every one of them—but most of all, I hated the ones who tried to be polite.</p>
<p class="text-left">Nobody here knows that I was brought up in an Orphans’ Home.</p>
<p class="text-left">I told Sallie McBride that my mother and father were dead.</p>
<p class="text-left">And I said that a kind old gentleman was sending me to college, which is true so far as it goes.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t want you to think I was afraid to tell the whole truth.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I do want to be like the other girls.</p>
<p class="text-left">That Dreadful( 可怕的 ) Home hanging over my childhood is the one great big difference.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I can turn my back on that and forget it all, I think I might be just as good as any other girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t believe there’s any real, underneath difference, do you?</p>
<p class="text-left">Anyway, Sallie McBride likes me!</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">Saturday morning</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve just been reading this letter over and it sounds pretty uncheerful( 不快乐的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">But can’t you guess that I have to write a special essay( 论文 ) before Monday morning, and there’ll be a geometry( 几何学 ) test, and I have a very bad cold?</p>
<p class="text-left">Sunday</p>
<p class="text-left">I forgot to post this yesterday, so I will add an angry postscript( 附言 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">We had a bishop( 主教 ) this morning, and what do you think he said?</p>
<p class="text-left">“The kindest promise made us in the Bible( 圣经 ) is this, ‘The poor will always be with you.’</p>
<p class="text-left">They were put here in order to keep us charitable( 仁慈的 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">The poor, please notice, are just put there to be useful to us.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I hadn’t grown into such a perfect lady, I should have gone up after the service and told him what I thought.</p>
<p class="text-left">October 25th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m in the basketball team, and you ought to see the bruise( 淤青 ) on my left shoulder.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s blue and brown, with little areas of orange.</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia Pendleton tried for the team, but she didn’t get in.</p>
<p class="text-left">Hooray( 万岁 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">You see what a mean girl I am.</p>
<p class="text-left">College gets nicer and nicer.</p>
<p class="text-left">I like the girls and the teachers and the classes and the buildings and the things to eat.</p>
<p class="text-left">We have ice cream( 冰激凌 ) twice a week and we never have cornmeal( 玉米片 ) porridge( 粥 ) like we did in the Home.</p>
<p class="text-left">You only wanted to hear from me once a month, didn’t you?</p>
<p class="text-left">And I’ve been bothering( 烦扰 ) you with letters every few days!</p>
<p class="text-left">But I’ve been so excited about all these new happenings that I must talk to somebody; and you’re the only one I know.</p>
<p class="text-left">Please excuse my enthusiasm( 激动 ); I’ll settle down( 平静下来 ) pretty soon.</p>
<p class="text-left">If my letters bore you, you can always throw them into the wastebasket( 垃圾桶 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I promise not to write another till the middle of November.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">November 15th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">You’ve never heard about my clothes, have you, Daddy?</p>
<p class="text-left">Six dresses, all new and beautiful and bought for me—not handed down from somebody bigger.</p>
<p class="text-left">Perhaps you don’t realize how exciting that is for an orphan?</p>
<p class="text-left">You gave them to me, and I am very, very, very grateful.</p></div>

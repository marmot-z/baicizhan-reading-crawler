                        <div><p class="text-left">She went to the door and spoke to the beggar child.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Who gave you those buns?” she asked her.</p>
<p class="text-left">The child nodded her head toward Sara’s disappearing figure.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What did she say?” asked the woman.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Asked me if I was hungry,” replied the hoarse( 嘶哑的 ) voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What did you say?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Said I was.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“And then she came in and got the buns, and gave them to you, did she?”</p>
<p class="text-left">The child nodded.</p>
<p class="text-left">“How many?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Five.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The woman thought it over.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Left just one for herself,” she said in a low voice, “and she could have eaten the whole six—I saw it in her eyes.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked after the little poor far-away figure and felt troubled in her usually comfortable mind.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I wish she hadn’t gone so quick,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I wish I could have given her twelve.” Then she turned to the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come in here,” said the woman, and she held open the shop door.</p>
<p class="text-left">The child got up and walked in.</p>
<p class="text-left">To be invited into a warm place full of bread seemed a wonderful thing.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not know what was going to happen.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not care, even.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Get yourself warm,” said the woman, pointing to a fire in the tiny back room.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And look here, when you are hard up for a bit of bread, you can come in here and ask for it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ll give it to you in honor of that young one.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara found some comfort in her remaining bun.</p>
<p class="text-left">At all events, it was very hot, and it was better than nothing.</p>
<p class="text-left">As she walked along, she broke off small pieces and ate them slowly to make them last longer.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Sara returned to the house she met Miss Minchin, who had come downstairs to scold( 斥责 ) the cook.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Where have you wasted your time?” she demanded.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You have been out for hours.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“It was so wet and muddy,” Sara answered, “it was hard to walk.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Make no excuses,” said Miss Minchin, “and tell no lies.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara went into the kitchen.</p>
<p class="text-left">“May I have something to eat?” Sara asked the cook rather weakly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Tea’s over and done with,” was the answer.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Did you expect me to keep it hot for you?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara stood silent for a second.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I had no dinner,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There’s some bread in the pantry( 食品储藏室 ),” said the cook.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That’s all you’ll get at this time of day.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara went and found the bread.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was old and hard and dry.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was difficult for the child to climb the three long flights of stairs leading to her attic.</p>
<p class="text-left">She often found them long when she was tired, but tonight it seemed as if she would never reach the top.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she reached the top landing of the attic stairs, she was glad to see the light coming from under her door.</p>
<p class="text-left">That meant that Ermengarde had managed to come up to pay her a visit.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yes, there Ermengarde was when she opened the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was sitting in the middle of the bed, with her feet placed safely under her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You do look tired, Sara,” she said; “you are quite pale.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am tired,” said Sara, dropping on to the uneven footstool.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I did not expect to see you tonight, Ermie.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Miss Amelia has gone out to spend the night with her old aunt,” she explained.</p>
<p class="text-left">“No one else ever comes and looks into the bedrooms after we are in bed. I could stay here until morning if I wanted to.”</p>
<p class="text-left">It was just at this minute that something happened at the skylight which neither of them saw.</p>
<p class="text-left">If either of them had by chance turned and looked up, she would have been surprised by the sight of a dark face.</p>
<p class="text-left">It looked carefully into the room and disappeared as quickly and almost as silently as it had appeared.</p>
<p class="text-left">Not quite as silently, however.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara, who had good hearing, suddenly turned a little and looked up at the roof.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That didn’t sound like Melchisedec,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What?” said Ermengarde, a little uncertain.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Didn’t you think you heard something?” asked Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“N-no,” Ermengarde said nervously. “Did you?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Perhaps I didn’t,” said Sara, “but I thought I did. It sounded as if something was on the roof—something that dragged softly.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“What could it be?” said Ermengarde.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Could it be—robbers( 盗贼 )?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No,” Sara began cheerfully.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There is nothing to steal—”</p>
<p class="text-left">She broke off in the middle of her words.</p>
<p class="text-left">They both heard the sound that checked her.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was not on the roof, but on the stairs below, and it was Miss Minchin’s angry voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara sprang off the bed, and put out the candle.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is scolding Becky,” she whispered, as she stood in the darkness. “She is making her cry.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Will she come in here?” Ermengarde whispered back, full of fear.</p>
<p class="text-left">“No. She will think I am in bed. Don’t move.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You ungrateful, dishonest child!” they heard her say.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Cook tells me she has missed things repeatedly.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“It wasn’t me, ma’am,” said Becky crying.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I was hungry enough, but it wasn’t me—never!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You deserve to be sent to prison,” said Miss Minchin’s voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Picking and stealing! Half a meat pie, indeed!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“It wasn’t me,” cried Becky.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I could have eaten a whole one—but I never laid a finger on it.”</p></div>

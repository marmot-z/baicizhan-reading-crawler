<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Isn’t it funny( 有趣的 )?</p>
<p class="text-left">I started to write to you yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p class="text-left">But as soon as I’d written the heading, “Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,” I remembered I’d promised to pick some blackberries( 黑莓 ) for dinner.</p>
<p class="text-left">So I went off and left the paper lying on the table, and when I came back today, what do you think I found sitting in the middle of the page?</p>
<p class="text-left">A real Daddy-Long-Legs!</p>
<p class="text-left">I picked him up very gently, and dropped him out of the window.</p>
<p class="text-left">I wouldn’t hurt one of them for the world.</p>
<p class="text-left">They always remind me of you.</p>
<p class="text-left">This is Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p class="text-left">Amasai (hired man) in a purple tie and some bright yellow gloves, has just driven off with Carrie (hired girl).</p>
<p class="text-left">Carrie is wearing a big hat with red roses and a blue dress, and she has curled( 弄卷 ) her hair. Amasai spent all the morning washing the carriage.</p>
<p class="text-left">Carrie stayed home from church; she said it was to cook lunch, but really it was to iron her dress.</p>
<p class="text-left">In two minutes more when this letter is finished, I am going to settle( 安顿 ) down to a book which I found in the attic( 阁楼 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s called “On the Trail( 小路 ),” and this is written across the front page in funny little-boy handwriting:</p>
<p class="text-left">Jervis Pendleton</p>
<p class="text-left">If this book should ever roam,</p>
<p class="text-left">Box its ears and send it home.</p>
<p class="text-left">He spent the summer here once after he had been ill, when he was about eleven years old.</p>
<p class="text-left">He left “On the Trail” behind.</p>
<p class="text-left">It looks well read—the marks of his dirty little hands are all over it!</p>
<p class="text-left">Also in a corner of the attic are some of his toys.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Semple talks so often about him that I begin to believe he really lives—not a grown man with a silk hat and walking stick, but a nice, dirty boy with uncombed( 未梳理的 ) hair</p>
<p class="text-left">who makes too much noise when he runs up the stairs( 楼梯 ), and leaves the screen doors open, and is always asking for cookies. (And getting them, too, if I know Mrs. Semple!)</p>
<p class="text-left">He seems to have been adventurous( 爱冒险的 ) and brave and truthful.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m sorry to think he is a Pendleton; he was meant for something better.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am sorry to tell you that my favorite cow, Buttercup, has done a disgraceful( 可耻的 ) thing.</p>
<p class="text-left">She got into the orchard( 果园 ) Friday evening and ate apples under the trees, and ate and ate until they made her completely drunk!</p>
<p class="text-left">Did you ever hear anything so shocking( 令人震惊的 )?</p>
<p class="text-left">Your loving orphan( 孤儿 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">September 25th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Look at me—a Second Year student!</p>
<p class="text-left">I came back last Friday, sorry to leave Lock Willow( 柳树 ), but glad to see the college again.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is a pleasant feeling to come back to a place I know.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am beginning to feel at home in college.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am beginning, in fact, to feel at home in the world—as though I were really part of it, rather than being looked down on as a stranger.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t suppose you understand in the least what I am trying to say.</p>
<p class="text-left">A person important enough to be a Trustee( 董事 ) can’t understand the feelings( 感受 ) of a person unimportant enough to be an orphan.</p>
<p class="text-left">And now, Daddy, listen to this.</p>
<p class="text-left">Whom do you think I am rooming( 与...合住 ) with?</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s the truth. We have a study and three little bedrooms.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie and I decided last spring that we should like to room together, and Julia made up her mind to stay with Sallie—I can’t imagine why, for they are not a bit alike( 相似的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">But the Pendletons hate change, so here we are.</p>
<p class="text-left">Think of Jerusha Abbott, formerly of the John Grier Home for Orphans, sharing rooms with a Pendleton!</p>
<p class="text-left">This is a democratic( 民主的 ) country.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie is running for class president( 班长 ), and I believe she is going to be elected( 被选上 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">You should see what politicians we are!</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, I tell you, Daddy, when we women get our rights, you men will have to work hard in order to keep yours.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am beginning chemistry, a most unusual study.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve never seen anything like it before.</p>
<p class="text-left">Molecules( 分子 ) and atoms( 原子 ) are the raw( 未经处理的 ) material.</p>
<p class="text-left">I hope I’ll be in a position to discuss them more next month.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am also taking debate( 辩论 ) and logic( 逻辑 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Also the history of the whole world.</p>
<p class="text-left">Also the plays of William Shakespeare.</p>
<p class="text-left">Also French.</p>
<p class="text-left">If this keeps up many years longer, I shall become quite intelligent( 聪明的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">There’s one girl in the class who talks in French as fast as she does in English.</p>
<p class="text-left">She went abroad with her parents when she was a child, and spent three years in a French school.</p>
<p class="text-left">You can imagine how bright she is compared with the rest of us—irregular verbs( 不规则动词 ) are just child’s play to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">I wish my parents had left me in a French school when I was little, instead of an Orphans’ Home.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh no, I don’t!</p>
<p class="text-left">Because then maybe I should never have known you.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’d rather know you than French.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours in politics,</p>
<p class="text-left">J. Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">October 17th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Supposing the swimming pool in the gymnasium( 体育馆 ) were filled with lemon jelly( 果酱 ), could a person trying to swim manage to keep on top or would he sink( 沉没 )?</p>
<p class="text-left">We were eating lemon jelly when the question came up.</p>
<p class="text-left">We discussed it for half an hour and we’re still not sure.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie thinks that she could swim in it, but I am perfectly sure that the best swimmer in the world would sink.</p>
<p class="text-left">Wouldn’t it be funny to be drowned( 被淹死 ) in lemon jelly?</p>
<p class="text-left">Did I ever tell you about the election?</p>
<p class="text-left">It happened three weeks ago, but it feels like ancient history already.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie won, and we had a parade( 游行 ) with a band( 一群 ) of fourteen players (three harmonicas( 口琴 ) and eleven combs).</p>
<p class="text-left">We’re very important people now in “258.”</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s not easy living with a president.</p>
<p class="text-left">Good night, dear Daddy.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your Judy</p></div>

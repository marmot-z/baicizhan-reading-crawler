                        <div><p class="text-left">Heidi would talk about her life,</p>
<p class="text-left">and make the grandmother smile and laugh, and in that way the hours flew by.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi became very fond of( 喜欢 ) the old grandmother,</p>
<p class="text-left">and when the weather was fair, she visited her every day that winter.</p>
<p class="text-left">Whenever the child remembered that the grandmother was blind, she would get very sad;</p>
<p class="text-left">her only comfort was that her coming brought such happiness.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather soon had fixed the cottage( 乡间小屋 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmother claimed that no noises could be heard anymore.</p>
<p class="text-left">She also said that thanks to the uncle’s kindness, she slept better that winter than she had done for many a year.</p>
<p class="text-left">Two winters had nearly passed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was happy, for the spring was coming again, with the delicious( 令人愉快的 ) wind that made the fir( 冷杉 ) trees roar( 咆哮 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">She was nearly eight years old, and had learned to take care of the goats( 山羊 ), who ran after her like little dogs.</p>
<p class="text-left">Several times the village teacher had sent word by Peter that the child was wanted in school.</p>
<p class="text-left">But the old man had not paid any attention to the message.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a beautiful morning in March.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was running to and fro before the door, when she suddenly saw an old gentleman, dressed in black, standing beside her.</p>
<p class="text-left">As she appeared frightened( 感到害怕的 ), he said kindly,</p>
<p class="text-left">“You must not be afraid of me, for I love children.</p>
<p class="text-left">Give me your hand, Heidi, and tell me where your grandfather is.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“He is inside,” the child replied, opening the door while she spoke.</p>
<p class="text-left">The old gentleman was in charge of the church in the village.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had known the grandfather years ago.</p>
<p class="text-left">After entering, he approached the grandfather, saying:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Good morning, neighbor.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather got up, surprised, and offering a seat to the visitor, said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Good morning. Here is a wooden chair, if it is good enough.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sitting down, the gentleman said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is long since I have seen you, neighbor.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have come today to talk over a matter with you.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am sure you can guess what it is about.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The gentleman here looked at Heidi, who was standing near the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Heidi, run out to see the goats,” said the grandfather,</p>
<p class="text-left">“and bring them some salt; you can stay till I come.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi disappeared on the spot( 立即 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“The child should have come to school a year ago,” the gentleman went on to say.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Didn’t you get the teacher’s warning? What do you intend( 打算 ) to do with the child?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I do not want her to go to school,” said the grandfather, decidedly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What do you want the child to be?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I want her to be free and happy as a bird!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But she is human, and it is high time for her to learn something.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have come now to tell you about it, so that you can make your plans.</p>
<p class="text-left">She must come to school next winter; remember that,” said the church man.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I shan’t do it!” was the reply.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You think I am going to send this delicate( 娇弱的 ) child to school in every storm and weather!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why don’t you come down to live among us again?” said the gentleman kindly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I couldn’t live in the village, for the people there and I hate each other;</p>
<p class="text-left">we had better keep apart.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The gentleman had risen.</p>
<p class="text-left">Holding out his hand, he said politely,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I shall count on you next winter, neighbor.</p>
<p class="text-left">We shall receive you gladly, when you make peace with God and man.”</p>
<p class="text-left">But the uncle replied firmly:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Thank you for your kindness, but you will have to wait in vain( 徒劳 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">“God be with you,” said the gentleman, and left him sadly.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather was out of humor that day,</p>
<p class="text-left">and when Heidi begged( 乞求 ) to go to see the grandmother, he only said in a low voice: “Not today.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Next day they had hardly finished their dinner, when another visitor arrived.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was Heidi’s aunt Deta;</p>
<p class="text-left">she wore a hat with feathers( 羽毛 ) and a dress with such a long train( 裙裾 ) that swept( 扫除 ) up the floor.</p>
<p class="text-left">While the uncle looked at her silently, Deta began to praise him and the child’s red cheeks( 脸颊 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">She told him that she had tried to provide for the child elsewhere,</p>
<p class="text-left">and at last she had found a splendid( 极好的 ) chance for her in Frankfurt.</p>
<p class="text-left">A rich relative of the lady, whom Deta had worked for, had a lame( 跛的 ) daughter.</p>
<p class="text-left">This poor little girl could not leave her wheelchair and needed a companion( 同伴 ) at her lessons.</p>
<p class="text-left">Deta had heard from her lady that a sweet child was wanted as playmate( 玩伴 ) and schoolmate for the disabled( 残疾的 ) girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had gone to the housekeeper( 管家 ) and told her all about Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">The lady, delighted( 高兴的 ) with the idea, had told her to fetch( 带 ) the child at once.</p>
<p class="text-left">So she had come now, and it was a lucky chance for Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">Deta said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Because one never knew what might happen in such a case, and who could tell—”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Have you finished?” the old man interrupted( 打断 ) her at last.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why? One might think I was telling you the silliest things.</p>
<p class="text-left">There is not a man who would not thank God for such news.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Bring them to somebody else, but not to me,” said the uncle coldly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Deta, flaming up( 发起火来 ), replied:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you want to hear what I think? Don’t I know how old she is?</p>
<p class="text-left">Eight years old and ignorant( 无知的 ) of everything.</p>
<p class="text-left">They have told me that you refuse to send her to church and to school.</p>
<p class="text-left">You had better give way or I shall get the people to back me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Be quiet!” the uncle thundered( 怒吼 ) with flaming( 愤怒的 ) eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Take her and ruin( 毁灭 ) her, but do not bring her before my sight again.</p>
<p class="text-left">I do not want to see her with feathers in her hat and terrible words like yours.”</p>
<p class="text-left">With big steps he walked out.</p></div>

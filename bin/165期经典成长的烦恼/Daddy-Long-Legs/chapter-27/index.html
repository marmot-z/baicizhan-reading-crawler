                        <div><p class="text-left">Where do you think my new novel( 小说 ) is?</p>
<p class="text-left">In the waste basket.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can see myself that it’s no good, and when a loving author realizes that, what would the public think?</p>
<p class="text-left">Later</p>
<p class="text-left">I write to you, Daddy, from a bed of pain.</p>
<p class="text-left">For two days I’ve been sick with enlarged tonsils( 扁桃体肿大 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I can drink hot milk with great difficulty, and that is all I can take.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why didn’t your parents have those tonsils out when you were a baby?” the doctor asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m sure I haven’t any idea, but I doubt if they were thinking much about me.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours,</p>
<p class="text-left">J. A.</p>
<p class="text-left">Next morning</p>
<p class="text-left">I just read this over before sending it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t know why I write such strange, disturbing( 令人不安的 ) things.</p>
<p class="text-left">Actually( 实际上 ) I am young and happy and full of life; and I trust you are the same.</p>
<p class="text-left">Youth has nothing to do with birthdays, only with aliveness( 活力 ) of spirit.</p>
<p class="text-left">So even if your hair is gray, Daddy, you can still be a boy.</p>
<p class="text-left">Love,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>

<p class="text-left">Dear Kind, Generous( 慷慨的 ) Man,</p>
<p class="text-left">Your check for my family came yesterday.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thank you so much!</p>
<p class="text-left">I took it down to them right after lunch, and you should have seen the girl’s face!</p>
<p class="text-left">She was so surprised and happy that she looked almost young.</p>
<p class="text-left">She’s only twenty-four.</p>
<p class="text-left">Isn’t it pitiful?</p>
<p class="text-left">Anyway, she feels now as though all the good things are coming together.</p>
<p class="text-left">She has steady( 持续的 ) work ahead for two months—someone’s getting married, and there’s a wedding dress to make.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Thank the good Lord!” cried the mother, when she understood the fact that that small piece of paper was one hundred dollars.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It wasn’t the good Lord at all,” I said, “it was Daddy-Long-Legs.” (Mr. Smith, I called you.)</p>
<p class="text-left">“But it was the good Lord who put it in his mind,” said she.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Not at all! I put it in his mind myself,” I replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">But anyway, Daddy, I trust the good Lord will reward( 奖励 ) you.</p>
<p class="text-left">You deserve ten thousand years out of purgatory( 炼狱 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours most gratefully( 感激地 ),</p>

<p class="text-left">Feb. 15th</p>
<p class="text-left">Just back from church—a preacher( 牧师 ) from Georgia.</p>
<p class="text-left">We must take care, he says, not to develop our minds too much at the expense of our emotional( 感情的 ) natures.</p>
<p class="text-left">It doesn’t matter where these preachers come from, we always get the same sermon( 布道 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Why don’t they go to men’s colleges and urge( 敦促 ) the students not to allow their manly natures to be ruined( 被毁灭 ) by too much thinking?</p>
<p class="text-left">Farewell( 再见 ), kind Sir.</p>
<p class="text-left">J. Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">March Fifth</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Mr. Trustee,</p>
<p class="text-left">Tomorrow is the first Wednesday in the month—a weary( 疲倦的 ) day for the John Grier Home.</p>
<p class="text-left">How happy they’ll be when five o’clock comes and you pat( 拍 ) them on the head and leave!</p>
<p class="text-left">Did you ever pat me on the head, Daddy?</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t believe so—I only remember fat Trustees( 董事 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Give the Home my love, please.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have quite a feeling of tenderness( 温柔 ) for it as I look back, four years later.</p>
<p class="text-left">When I first came to college I felt quite angry because I hadn’t had a normal( 正常的 ) childhood.</p>
<p class="text-left">But now I don’t feel that way in the least.</p>
<p class="text-left">My childhood has given me a perspective( 观点 ) on the world that other people don’t have.</p>
<p class="text-left">I know lots of girls (Julia, for instance) who never know that they are happy.</p>
<p class="text-left">They are so used to the feeling that they don’t notice it.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I am perfectly sure every moment of my life that I am happy.</p>
<p class="text-left">And I’m going to keep on being happy, no matter what unpleasant things turn up.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m going to treat them (even toothaches( 牙痛 )) as interesting experiences, and be glad to know what they feel like.</p>
<p class="text-left">However, Daddy, don’t take this love for the J.G.H. too seriously.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I have five children, I shan’t leave them on the steps of an Orphans( 孤儿 )’ Home in order to make sure they are brought up simply.</p>
<p class="text-left">Give my kindest regards( 问候 ) to Mrs. Lippett (that, I think, is truthful; love would be a little strong) and don’t forget to tell her what a beautiful nature I’ve developed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Love,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">LOCK WILLOW( 柳树 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">April 4th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy,</p>
<p class="text-left">Notice the address.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie and I are spending Easter Vacation here.</p>
<p class="text-left">We decided that the best thing we could do with our ten days was to find a quiet place.</p>
<p class="text-left">We are walking over the hills and reading and writing, and having a nice, restful time.</p>
<p class="text-left">We climbed to the top of Sky Hill this morning, where Master( 老爷 ) Jervie and I once cooked dinner.</p>
<p class="text-left">It doesn’t seem possible that it was nearly two years ago.</p>
<p class="text-left">I could still see the place where the smoke of our fire blackened the rock.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is funny how certain places get connected with certain people, and you never go back without thinking of them.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was quite lonely without him—for two minutes.</p>
<p class="text-left">What do you think is my latest activity, Daddy?</p>
<p class="text-left">You will begin to believe that I never learn—I am writing another book.</p>
<p class="text-left">I started it three weeks ago and am eating it up in chunks( 大块 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve understood the secret. Master Jervie and that editor( 编辑 ) were right; you are most convincing( 令人信服的 ) when you write about the things you know.</p>
<p class="text-left">And this time it is about something that I do know—very well.</p>
<p class="text-left">Guess where it’s set?</p>
<p class="text-left">In the John Grier Home!</p>
<p class="text-left">And it’s good, Daddy—it’s just about the tiny little things that happened every day.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m a realist now.</p>
<p class="text-left">I shall go back to romance( 爱情故事 ) when my own exciting future begins.</p>
<p class="text-left">This new book is going to get itself finished—and published( 被出版 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">You’ll see!</p>
<p class="text-left">If you just want a thing hard enough and keep on trying, you do get it in the end.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve been trying for four years to get a letter from you—and I haven’t given up hope yet.</p>
<p class="text-left">Goodbye, Daddy dear.</p>
<p class="text-left">Love,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p></div>

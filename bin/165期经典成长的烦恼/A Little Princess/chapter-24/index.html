                        <div><p class="text-left">In one second it was in her cold little hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh,” she cried, “it is true! It is true!”</p>
<p class="text-left">And then, if you will believe me, she looked straight at the shop directly facing her.</p>
<p class="text-left">And it was a baker’s shop.</p>
<p class="text-left">A cheerful motherly woman with pink cheeks was putting into the window a tray( 托盘 ) of delicious newly baked hot buns—large, shiny buns, with currants( 黑加仑 ) in them.</p>
<p class="text-left">It almost made Sara feel weak for a few seconds—the surprise, and the sight of the buns, and the delightful smells of warm bread coming from the baker’s window.</p>
<p class="text-left">She knew she should not wait to use the little piece of money.</p>
<p class="text-left">So she crossed the pavement and put her wet foot on the step.</p>
<p class="text-left">As she did so she saw something that made her stop.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a little figure more unhappy even than herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was not much more than a pile of rags, from which small muddy feet stuck out.</p>
<p class="text-left">Above the rags appeared a head of messy hair, and a dirty face with big hungry eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara knew they were hungry eyes the moment she saw them, and she felt a sudden need to help her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“This,” she said to herself, with a little sigh, “is one of the common people—and she is hungrier than I am.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The child—this “one of the common people”—looked up at Sara, and moved herself to the side a little, so as to give her room to pass.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara held onto her little fourpenny piece and stopped for a few seconds.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she spoke to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are you hungry?” she asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, very,” the child said in a rough voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Haven’t you had any dinner?” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“No dinner, nor yet no breakfast—nor yet no supper. No nothing.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Since when?” asked Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Don’t know. Never got nothing today—nowhere. I’ve asked and asked.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Just to look at her made Sara more hungry and weak.</p>
<p class="text-left">But those little thoughts were at work in her brain.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If I’m a princess,” she thought, “should I do what princesses do?</p>
<p class="text-left">When they were poor and driven from their thrones( 王位 ), they always share with the common people, especially if they meet one poorer and hungrier than themselves.</p>
<p class="text-left">They always shared.</p>
<p class="text-left">Buns are a penny each.</p>
<p class="text-left">If it had been sixpence I could have eaten six.</p>
<p class="text-left">It won’t be enough for either of us.</p>
<p class="text-left">But it will be better than nothing.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Wait a minute,” she said to the beggar child.</p>
<p class="text-left">She went into the shop.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was warm and smelled delicious.</p>
<p class="text-left">The woman was just going to put some more hot buns into the window.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you want to buy something?” the woman asked, as she saw Sara look at the buns.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Four buns, if you please,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Those at a penny each.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The woman went to the window and put some in a paper bag.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara noticed that she put in six.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I said four, if you please,” she explained.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have only fourpence.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’ll throw in two more,” said the woman with her kind look.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’m sure you can eat them sometime. Aren’t you hungry?”</p>
<p class="text-left">A mist rose before Sara’s eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” she answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am very hungry, and I am very thankful to you for your kindness.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Sara left the bakery, the beggar girl was still curled up in the corner of the step.</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked frightful in her wet and dirty rags.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara opened the paper bag and took out one of the hot buns, which had already warmed her own cold hands a little.</p>
<p class="text-left">“See,” she said, giving the bun to the child, “this is nice and hot. Eat it, and you will not feel so hungry.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The child started and looked up at her, as if such sudden, wonderful good luck almost frightened her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she quickly picked up the bun and began to stuff( 把...塞进...里 ) it into her mouth with great animal-like bites.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, my! Oh, my!” Sara heard her say roughly, with wild happiness. “Oh, my!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara took out three more buns and put them down.</p>
<p class="text-left">The sound in the rough, hungry voice was awful.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is hungrier than I am,” she said to herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She’s starving( 饿极了的 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">But her hand shook when she put down the fourth bun.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’m not starving,” she said—and she put down the fifth.</p>
<p class="text-left">The little girl was still eating when she turned away.</p>
<p class="text-left">Even if she had ever been taught to be polite, she was too hungry to give any thanks.</p>
<p class="text-left">But actually, she had never been taught at all.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Good-bye,” said Sara, and she walked away.</p>
<p class="text-left">At that moment the baker woman looked out of her shop window.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Well, I have never seen anything like this!” she cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That young one gave her buns to a beggar child!</p>
<p class="text-left">It wasn’t because she didn’t want them, either.</p>
<p class="text-left">Well, well, she looked hungry enough.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’d give something to know what she did it for.”</p></div>

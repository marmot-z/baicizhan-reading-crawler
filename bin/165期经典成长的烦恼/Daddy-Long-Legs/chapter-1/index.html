                        <div><p class="text-left">DADDY-LONG-LEGS</p>
<p class="text-left">Blue Wednesday</p>
<p class="text-left">The first Wednesday in every month was a Perfectly Awful Day.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a day that one waited for with fear, tried to get through with courage, and forgot as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="text-left">Every floor must be perfectly clean, every chair free of dust( 灰尘 ), and every bed without a wrinkle( 褶皱 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Ninety-seven little orphans( 孤儿 ) must be washed and dressed in their best clothes.</p>
<p class="text-left">All ninety-seven must be reminded( 被提醒 ) of their manners, and told to say, “Yes, sir,” “No, sir,” whenever a Trustee( 董事 ) spoke.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a difficult time, and poor Jerusha Abbott, being the oldest orphan, had to bear the worst of it.</p>
<p class="text-left">But this particular first Wednesday, like the others before it, finally came to an end.</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha left the kitchen where she had been making sandwiches for the guests, and went upstairs( 上楼 ) to finish her regular( 日常的 ) work.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her special care was room F, where eleven little children, from four to seven years old, had their eleven little beds all in a row.</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha lined them up, straightened their dresses, and wiped their noses.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she led them in an orderly and willing line towards the dining room to enjoy a happy half hour with bread and milk and fruit pudding.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she dropped down on the window seat and rested her aching( 疼痛的 ) head against the cool glass.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had been on her feet since five that morning, taking orders from everyone, scolded( 训斥 ) and hurried by a nervous matron( 女总管 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Lippett, behind the scenes, was not always as calm( 冷静 )—or as kind—as she tried to appear when she faced the Trustees.</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha looked out across the lawn( 草坪 ), beyond the tall iron fence( 围栏 ), to the village in the distance.</p>
<p class="text-left">The day had ended—quite successfully, as far as she knew.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Trustees had toured the property, and read their reports, and drunk their tea.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now they were hurrying back to their own cheerful homes, to forget about the orphans and their problems for another month.</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha watched all the cars as they left.</p>
<p class="text-left">In her imagination she followed first one car, then another, back to the big houses where their owners lived.</p>
<p class="text-left">She saw herself in a fur coat( 裘皮大衣 ) and an expensive hat, sitting back in the seat and saying “Home” to the driver.</p>
<p class="text-left">But at the door of her imagined home, the picture grew blurred( 模糊的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha had an imagination—such a powerful one that Mrs. Lippett had even told her that her imagination would get her into trouble if she didn’t take care.</p>
<p class="text-left">But her imagination could not carry her beyond the front door of that home.</p>
<p class="text-left">Poor little Jerusha, in all her seventeen years, had never stepped inside an ordinary house.</p>
<p class="text-left">She could not picture the daily life of those other humans who lived their lives without having to look after orphans.</p>
<p class="text-left">Je-ru-sha Ab-bott</p>
<p class="text-left">You are wan-ted</p>
<p class="text-left">In the of-fice,</p>
<p class="text-left">And I think you’d</p>
<p class="text-left">Better hurry up!</p>
<p class="text-left">Tommy Dillon’s singing grew louder as he got nearer to room F. Jerusha tore herself away( 依依不舍地离开 ) from the window and faced the troubles of life again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Who wants me?” she asked Tommy, anxiously( 紧张地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Lippett in the office,</p>
<p class="text-left">And I think she’s angry.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ah-a-men!</p>
<p class="text-left">Tommy was having a little fun by singing the message as if it were a hymn( 赞美诗 ), but he was not trying to be cruel.</p>
<p class="text-left">Even the most hardened little orphan felt sorry for someone sent to the office to face an angry matron.</p>
<p class="text-left">And Tommy liked Jerusha, even if she did sometimes pull him by the arm and wash his face much too hard.</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha wondered what could have gone wrong.</p>
<p class="text-left">Were the sandwiches not thin enough?</p>
<p class="text-left">Had a lady visitor seen the hole in Susie Hawthorn’s stocking( 长袜 )?</p>
<p class="text-left">Worst of all—had one of the sweet little children in her own room F been rude to a Trustee?</p>
<p class="text-left">The long lower hall had not been lighted.</p>
<p class="text-left">As she came down the stairs, a last Trustee stood in the open door.</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha noticed only one thing about the man—that he was very tall.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was waving( 挥动 ) his arm to let the driver of his car know that he was ready to leave.</p>
<p class="text-left">As the car came nearer, its headlights( 头灯 ) threw his shadow( 影子 ) sharply( 清晰地 ) against the wall inside.</p>
<p class="text-left">The shadow had very long legs and arms that ran along the floor and up the wall.</p>
<p class="text-left">It looked exactly like a huge daddy-long-legs.</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha’s worry suddenly changed to laughter.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was by nature a happy person, and would laugh at anything even a little bit funny.</p>
<p class="text-left">If one could get any sort of fun out of a serious person such as a Trustee, then that was an unexpected pleasure.</p>
<p class="text-left">She walked on to the office looking much happier, and presented a smiling face to Mrs. Lippett.</p>
<p class="text-left">To her surprise, the matron was also, if not exactly smiling, at least relatively friendly.</p>
<p class="text-left">She wore an expression almost as pleasant as the one she used for visitors.</p></div>

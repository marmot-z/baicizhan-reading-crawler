<p class="text-left">The gentleman’s name is not John Smith, but he wishes to remain unknown.</p>
<p class="text-left">To you he will never be anyone but John Smith.</p>
<p class="text-left">He wants you to write to him because he thinks that writing letters is the best way to become a good writer.</p>
<p class="text-left">Since you have no family to write to, he wants you to write to him instead.</p>
<p class="text-left">Also, he wishes to follow your progress.</p>
<p class="text-left">He will never answer your letters, nor take any notice of them in any way.</p>
<p class="text-left">He hates writing letters, and does not wish to be forced to write back.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you find yourself in a situation where an answer is needed, you may write to Mr. Griggs, his secretary.</p>
<p class="text-left">You must send these monthly letters.</p>
<p class="text-left">They are the only payment that Mr. Smith requires, so you must be as conscientious( 谨慎 ) in sending them as though you were paying a bill.</p>
<p class="text-left">I hope that they will always be respectful.</p>
<p class="text-left">You must remember that you are writing to a Trustee( 董事 ) of the John Grier Home.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha’s eyes looked towards the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">She wished only to get away and think.</p>
<p class="text-left">She rose and took a small step back.</p>
<p class="text-left">But Mrs. Lippett thought it was a perfect opportunity to make a speech to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I trust that you are properly grateful( 感激 ) for your good luck?</p>
<p class="text-left">Not many girls in your position ever have such an opportunity to rise in the world.</p>
<p class="text-left">You must always remember—”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I—yes, ma’am, thank you.</p>
<p class="text-left">If that’s all, I must go and fix Freddie Perkins’s trousers.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The door closed behind her, and Mrs. Lippett watched it with an open mouth.</p>
<p class="text-left">The girl had given her no chance to make her great speech.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Letters of Miss Jerusha Abbott to Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith</p>
<p class="text-left">215 FERGUSSEN HALL</p>
<p class="text-left">September 24th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Kind-Trustee-Who-Sends-Orphans-to-College,</p>
<p class="text-left">Here I am!</p>
<p class="text-left">I travelled yesterday for four hours in a train.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s a funny feeling, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="text-left">I never rode in one before.</p>
<p class="text-left">College is the biggest, most confusing( 复杂的 ) place—I get lost whenever I leave my room.</p>
<p class="text-left">I will write you a description later when I’m feeling less confused.</p>
<p class="text-left">Also, I will tell you about my lessons.</p>
<p class="text-left">Classes don’t begin until Monday morning, and this is Saturday night.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I wanted to write a letter first, so that you can get to know me.</p>
<p class="text-left">It seems strange to be writing letters to somebody you don’t know.</p>
<p class="text-left">It seems strange for me to be writing letters at all.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve never written more than three or four in my life, so please forgive me if these are not quite the kind you were expecting.</p>
<p class="text-left">Before leaving yesterday morning, Mrs. Lippett and I had a very serious talk.</p>
<p class="text-left">She told me how to behave( 举止规矩有礼 ) all the rest of my life, and especially how to behave towards the kind gentleman who is doing so much for me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I must take care to be Very Respectful.</p>
<p class="text-left">But how can one be very respectful to a person who wishes to be called John Smith?</p>
<p class="text-left">Why couldn’t you have picked out a name with a little personality( 个性 )?</p>
<p class="text-left">I have been thinking about you a great deal this summer.</p>
<p class="text-left">Having somebody take an interest in me after all these years makes me feel as though I had found a sort of family.</p>
<p class="text-left">I feel as if I belonged( 属于 ) to somebody now, and it’s a very comfortable feeling.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I must say that when I think about you, my imagination has very little to work upon.</p>
<p class="text-left">There are just three things that I know:</p>
<p class="text-left">1. You are tall.</p>
<p class="text-left">2. You are rich.</p>
<p class="text-left">3. You hate girls.</p>
<p class="text-left">I suppose I might call you Dear Mr. Girl-Hater.</p>
<p class="text-left">Only that’s rather insulting( 侮辱的 ) to me.</p>
<p class="text-left">Or Dear Mr. Rich-Man, but that’s insulting to you, as though money were the only important thing about you. Besides, maybe you won’t stay rich all your life.</p>
<p class="text-left">Lots of very clever men have lost everything on Wall Street. But at least you will stay tall all your life!</p>
<p class="text-left">So I’ve decided to call you Dear Daddy-Long-Legs.</p>
<p class="text-left">I hope you won’t mind.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s just a private pet name( 昵称 ) we won’t tell Mrs. Lippett about.</p>
<p class="text-left">The ten o’clock bell is going to ring in two minutes.</p>
<p class="text-left">Our day is divided into sections by bells.</p>
<p class="text-left">We eat and sleep and study by bells.</p>
<p class="text-left">I feel like a fireman( 消防员 ) who must run when he hears the fire-bell.</p>
<p class="text-left">There it goes! Lights out. Good night.</p>
<p class="text-left">Notice how well I obey( 遵守 ) the rules—due to my training in the John Grier Home.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours most respectfully,</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha Abbott</p></div>

<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">You should see the way this college is studying!</p>
<p class="text-left">We’ve forgotten we ever had a vacation.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have introduced fifty-seven irregular( 不规则的 ) verbs( 动词 ) to my brain in the past four days—I’m only hoping they’ll stay till after examinations.</p>
<p class="text-left">Some of the girls sell their textbooks( 教科书 ) when they’re through with them, but I’m going to keep mine.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then after I’ve graduated( 毕业 ), I shall have my whole education in a row in the bookcase( 书架 ), and when I need to use any of it, I can find it at once.</p>
<p class="text-left">So much easier and more accurate( 准确的 ) than trying to keep it in your head.</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia Pendleton dropped in this evening to pay a social call, and stayed a whole hour.</p>
<p class="text-left">She got started on the subject of family, and I couldn’t change the subject.</p>
<p class="text-left">She wanted to know what my mother’s maiden( 娘家姓 ) name was.</p>
<p class="text-left">I didn’t have the courage to say I didn’t know.</p>
<p class="text-left">So I just decided on the first name I could think of, and that was Montgomery.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she wanted to know whether I was one of the Massachusetts Montgomerys or the Virginia Montgomerys.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her mother was a Rutherford.</p>
<p class="text-left">The family came over in the ark( 舟 ), and were connected by marriage with Henry the Eighth.</p>
<p class="text-left">On her father’s side they date back further than Adam.</p>
<p class="text-left">On the topmost branches( 分支 ) of her family tree there are some very high-class monkeys with very fine silky hair and long tails.</p>
<p class="text-left">I meant to write you a nice, cheerful, entertaining( 使人愉快的 ) letter tonight, but I’m too sleepy—and scared( 害怕的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The first-year student’s situation is not a happy one.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours, about to be examined,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">Sunday</p>
<p class="text-left">Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">I have some awful, awful, awful news to tell you, but I won’t begin with it; I’ll try to get you in a good mood( 心情 ) first.</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha Abbott is now a published( 出版过书的 ) author.</p>
<p class="text-left">A poem called “From my Tower” appears in the February Monthly—on the first page, which is a very great honor( 荣幸 ) for a first-year.</p>
<p class="text-left">My English instructor has told me that it is a charming( 迷人的 ) piece of work except for the sixth line, which had too many feet.</p>
<p class="text-left">I will send you a copy in case you care to read it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Let me see if I can’t think of something else pleasant—Oh, yes! I’m learning to skate, and can glide( 滑行 ) about quite respectably all by myself.</p>
<p class="text-left">Also I’ve learned how to slide( 滑动 ) down a rope from the top of the gymnasium( 体育馆 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I can jump over a bar( 围栏 ) three feet and six inches( 英寸 ) high—I hope shortly to increase that up to four feet.</p>
<p class="text-left">We had a very inspiring( 鼓舞人心的 ) sermon( 布道 ) this morning by the Bishop( 主教 ) of Alabama.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was about the necessity of overlooking( 看漏 ) mistakes in others, and not discouraging( 使灰心 ) people by harsh( 严厉的 ) judgments( 看法 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I wish you had heard it.</p>
<p class="text-left">This is the sunniest( 阳光最充足的 ), most blinding winter afternoon, with all the world bending( 弯曲 ) under a weight of snow—except me, and I’m bending under a weight of sorrow( 悲伤 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Now for the news—courage, Judy!—You must tell.</p>
<p class="text-left">Are you really in a good mood?</p>
<p class="text-left">I failed in mathematics and Latin( 拉丁语 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m taking extra( 额外的 ) classes in them, and will take another examination next month.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m sorry if you’re disappointed( 失望的 ), but otherwise I don’t care a bit because I’ve learned such a lot of things not mentioned in the college handbook( 手册 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve read seventeen novels( 小说 ) and lots of poetry—really necessary novels like Vanity( 名利场 ) Fair and Alice in Wonderland.</p>
<p class="text-left">Also the first half of Gibbon’s Roman Empire( 罗马帝国 ) and half of Benvenuto Cellini’s Life—wasn’t he entertaining?</p>
<p class="text-left">He used to go for a walk and casually( 随意地 ) kill a man before breakfast.</p>
<p class="text-left">So you see, Daddy, I’m much more well-read than if I’d just stuck to Latin.</p>
<p class="text-left">Will you forgive( 原谅 ) me this once if I promise never to fail again?</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours in sackcloth( 粗麻布 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">This is an extra letter in the middle of the month because I’m rather lonely tonight.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s awfully stormy.</p>
<p class="text-left">All the lights are out, but I drank black coffee and I can’t go to sleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">I had a dinner party this evening with Sallie and Julia and Leonora Fenton.</p>
<p class="text-left">We had sardines( 沙丁鱼 ) and hot muffins( 松饼 ) and salad and coffee.</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia said she’d had a good time, but Sallie stayed to help wash the dishes.</p>
<p class="text-left">I might, very usefully, put some time on Latin tonight but, there’s no doubt about it, I’m a very lazy Latin student.</p>
<p class="text-left">Would you mind, just for a little while, pretending( 假装 ) you are my grandmother?</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie has one and Julia and Leonora each have two, and they were all comparing them tonight.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can’t think of anything I’d rather have; it’s such a respectable relationship.</p>
<p class="text-left">When I went into town yesterday, I saw the sweetest cap of Cluny lace( 蕾丝边 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">So, if you don’t mind, I am going to give it to you on your eighty-third birthday.</p>
<p class="text-left">! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !</p>
<p class="text-left">That’s the clock striking twelve.</p>
<p class="text-left">I believe I am sleepy after all.</p>
<p class="text-left">Good night, Granny( 外婆 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I love you dearly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left"></p>
<p class="text-left">The Ides of March</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear D. L. L.,</p>
<p class="text-left">I am learning how to write Latin. I have been studying it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I shall be studying it. I shall have been studying it.</p>
<p class="text-left">My re-examination is at the 7th period next Tuesday, and I am going to pass or BUST( 失败 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I will write a respectable letter when it’s over.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours—in evident haste( 匆忙 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">J. A.</p></div>

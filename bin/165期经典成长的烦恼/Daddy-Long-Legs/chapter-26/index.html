                        <div><p class="text-left">It was a very nice, fatherly letter—but frank( 直率的 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">He said he saw from the address that I was still at college.</p>
<p class="text-left">His advice was that I should put all of my energy into my lessons, and wait until I graduated( 毕业 ) before beginning to write.</p>
<p class="text-left">He added his reader’s opinion.</p>
<p class="text-left">Here it is:</p>
<p class="text-left">“The author does not yet understand how real people talk and act.</p>
<p class="text-left">A good deal of humor, but not always in the best of taste.</p>
<p class="text-left">Tell her to keep on trying, and in time she may produce a real book.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And I thought I was making a notable addition to American literature( 文学 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I was planning to surprise you by writing a great novel( 小说 ) before I graduated.</p>
<p class="text-left">I collected the material for it while I was at Julia’s last Christmas.</p>
<p class="text-left">But the editor( 编辑 ) may be right.</p>
<p class="text-left">Probably two weeks was not long enough to understand the manners and customs( 风俗 ) of a great city.</p>
<p class="text-left">I burned the book, and went to bed completely discouraged( 气馁的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I thought I was never going to be good for anything, and that you had thrown away your money for nothing.</p>
<p class="text-left">But what do you think?</p>
<p class="text-left">I woke up this morning with a beautiful new book idea in my head, and I’ve been going about all day planning my characters, just as happy as I could be.</p>
<p class="text-left">No one can ever accuse( 指责 ) me of being a pessimist( 悲观主义者 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">If I had a husband and twelve children swallowed( 吞噬 ) by an earthquake one day, I’d get up the next morning with a smile, and start looking for another set.</p>
<p class="text-left">Love,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">December 14th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">I had the strangest dream last night.</p>
<p class="text-left">I thought I went into a book store, and there was a new book called The Life and Letters of Judy Abbott.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was red, with a picture of the John Grier Home on the cover, and a picture of me inside with “Very truly yours, Judy Abbott,” written below.</p>
<p class="text-left">But just as I was trying to find out whom I’m going to marry and when I’m going to die, I woke up.</p>
<p class="text-left">Would you want to read the story of your life—written by an author who knew everything?</p>
<p class="text-left">What if you could never forget it, but would always know what would happen next, and the exact day and time when you would die?</p>
<p class="text-left">How many people would have the courage to read it then, and live without hope and without surprises?</p>
<p class="text-left">Life can be boring sometimes—eat, sleep, repeat.</p>
<p class="text-left">But imagine how much more boring it would be if nothing unexpected ever happened.</p>
<p class="text-left">We’re studying philosophy( 哲学 ) now—interesting but hard to get hold of.</p>
<p class="text-left">I prefer( 更喜欢 ) biology( 生物 ), where you can pin( 把…钉住 ) the subject under discussion to a board.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you believe in free will? I do.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t agree at all with the philosophers( 哲学家 ) who think that every action is the inevitable( 不可避免的 ) result of previous( 之前的 ) causes.</p>
<p class="text-left">I believe in my own free will and my own power to succeed—and that is the belief that moves mountains.</p>
<p class="text-left">You watch me become a great author!</p>
<p class="text-left">I have four chapters of my new book finished, and have rough( 大致的 ) versions of five more.</p>
<p class="text-left">This is a very intellectual( 需要用脑力的 ) sort of letter—does your head hurt, Daddy?</p>
<p class="text-left">I think I’ll stop now and make some candy.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m sorry I can’t send you a piece; it will be unusually good, for we’re going to make it with real cream( 奶油 ) and lots of butter( 黄油 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Love,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S. We’re dancing in gymnasium( 体育馆 ) class.</p>
<p class="text-left">You can see by this picture how much we look like a real ballet( 芭蕾舞团 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I am the one at the end, looking so graceful( 优雅的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">December 26th</p>
<p class="text-left">My Dear, Dear, Daddy,</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t you have any sense?</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t you know that you mustn’t give one girl seventeen Christmas presents?</p>
<p class="text-left">Think how embarrassing( 尴尬的 ) it would be if we ever quarreled( 吵架 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">I should have to hire( 租用 ) a moving van( 搬运车 ) to return your gifts.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thank you, Daddy, a thousand times.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think you’re the sweetest man that ever lived—and the most foolish( 愚蠢的 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">January 9th</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you wish to do something, Daddy, that will make sure you go to Heaven( 天堂 )?</p>
<p class="text-left">There is a family here who are in a very bad situation.</p>
<p class="text-left">They have four children still at home.</p>
<p class="text-left">The two older boys have disappeared into the world to make their fortune( 发财 ), and have not sent any of it back.</p>
<p class="text-left">The father worked in a glass factory and got sick—it’s awfully unhealthy work—and now has been sent away to a hospital.</p>
<p class="text-left">That took all their savings, and the support of the family falls upon the oldest daughter, who is twenty-four.</p>
<p class="text-left">She makes dresses for $1.50 a day (when she can get the work) and does embroidery( 刺绣 ) in the evening.</p>
<p class="text-left">The mother isn’t very strong; also, she believes in God, and so refuses to do anything herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">She sits with her hands folded( 交叉起来 ), while the daughter kills herself with overwork( 工作过度 ) and worry.</p>
<p class="text-left">She doesn’t see how they are going to get through the rest of the winter—and I don’t either.</p>
<p class="text-left">One hundred dollars would buy some coal and some shoes for three children so that they could go to school.</p>
<p class="text-left">And it would leave a little over, so that she needn’t worry herself to death when a few days pass and she doesn’t get work.</p>
<p class="text-left">You are the richest man I know.</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t you suppose you could spare one hundred dollars?</p>
<p class="text-left">That girl deserves( 值得 ) help a lot more than I ever did.</p>
<p class="text-left">I wouldn’t ask it except for the girl; I don’t care much what happens to the mother—she is such a jelly-fish.</p>
<p class="text-left">The way people are forever( 永远 ) looking up to heaven and saying “Perhaps it’s all for the best,” when they are perfectly sure it’s not, makes me so angry.</p>
<p class="text-left">Fatalism( 宿命论 ), or whatever you choose to call it, is simply another word for laziness.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m for a more active religion( 宗教信仰 )!</p></div>

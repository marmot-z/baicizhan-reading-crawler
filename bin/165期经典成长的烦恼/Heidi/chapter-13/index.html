                        <div><p class="text-left">When Heidi opened her eyes next morning, she was eager( 渴望 ) to look at the sky and the ground below.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had always done so at home.</p>
<p class="text-left">She felt very disappointed( 失望的 ) when she found that the windows were too high for her to see anything except walls and windows.</p>
<p class="text-left">The poor child felt like a little bird that was placed in a beautiful cage( 笼 ) for the first time.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara looked much happier than usual.</p>
<p class="text-left">When breakfast had passed, the two children were allowed to go into the library together and were soon left alone.</p>
<p class="text-left">“How can I see down to the ground?” Heidi asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Open a window and look out,” replied Clara, amused( 发笑 ) at the question.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But it is impossible to open them,” Heidi said, sadly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh no. You can’t do it and I can’t help you, either, but if you ask Sebastian he’ll do it for you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was relieved( 感到宽慰的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The poor child had felt like a prisoner( 囚犯 ) in her room.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara now asked Heidi what her home had been like, and Heidi told her gladly about her life in the hut( 小屋 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">In the afternoon, while Clara was resting, Heidi was left to herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">She planted herself in the hall and waited for the butler( 男管家 ) to come upstairs( 上楼 ) with the silver tea-things.</p>
<p class="text-left">When he reached the head of the stairs( 楼梯 ), she said to him,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I want to ask you something.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She saw that the butler seemed surprised, so she made him feel better by saying that she did not mean any harm.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What can I do for you?” asked Sebastian.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Can you open a window for me?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Certainly,” he replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sebastian got a chair for Heidi, for the window was too high for her to see.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi looked out of the window and in great disappointment turned her head away.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t see anything but a street of stone. Is it the same way on the other side of the house?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Where do you go to look far down on everything?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“On a church tower. Do you see that one over there with the golden top?</p>
<p class="text-left">From there you can overlook( 俯瞰 ) everything.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi immediately stepped down from the chair and ran downstairs( 下楼 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Opening the door, she found herself in the street, but she could not see the tower anymore.</p>
<p class="text-left">She wandered( 漫步 ) on from street to street, too afraid to ask any of the busy people where to go.</p>
<p class="text-left">While she was wandering down the street, she found herself before an old church with a tower.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was puzzled( 感到疑惑的 ) what to do next, but having discovered a bell, she pulled it with all her might.</p>
<p class="text-left">The lock made a sound from inside, and an old man opened the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">In an angry voice, he said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why do you ring for me? Can’t you see that it is only for those who want to see the tower?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But I do,” said Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What do you want to see? Did anybody send you?” asked the man.</p>
<p class="text-left">“No, but I want to look down from up there.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Get home and don’t try it again.”</p>
<p class="text-left">With those words the tower-keeper was going to shut the door, but Heidi held his coattails( 燕尾服的燕尾 ) and asked him to let her come.</p>
<p class="text-left">The tower-keeper looked at the child’s eyes, which were nearly full of tears( 眼泪 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“All right, come along, if you care so much,” he said, taking her by the hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">The two climbed up many, many steps, which got narrower( 变窄 ) all the time.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they had arrived on top, the old man lifted Heidi up to the open window.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi saw nothing but a sea of chimneys( 烟囱 ), roofs( 屋顶 ) and towers, and her heart sank( 情绪低落 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, dear, it’s different from the way I thought it would be,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There! What could such a little girl know about a view?</p>
<p class="text-left">We’ll go down now and you must promise never to ring at my tower anymore.”</p>
<p class="text-left">On their way downstairs they saw a large gray cat guarding her new family in a basket.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi looked at her in surprise, and was delighted( 高兴的 ) when the old man opened the basket.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What cute kittens( 小猫 ), what smart little creatures( 生物 )!” she shouted in her delight( 高兴 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">when she saw them crawling( 爬 ) about, jumping and rolling( 翻 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Would you like to have one?” the old man asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“For me? To keep? How can I take them with me?” Heidi asked, for she could not believe her ears.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I can bring them to your house, if you tell me where you live,” said Heidi’s new friend.</p>
<p class="text-left">How happy Heidi was! Clara would be delighted when she saw the cute things.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Bring them to Mr. Sesemann’s house; there is a golden dog on the door, with a ring in his mouth.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The old man had lived in the tower for a long time and knew everybody;</p>
<p class="text-left">Sebastian also was a special friend of his.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I know,” he said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But to whom shall I send them? Do you belong to( 属于 ) Mr. Sesemann?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No. Please send them to Clara; she will like them, I am sure.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi could hardly tear herself away( 舍不得离开 ) from the pretty things, so the old man put one kitten in each of her pockets to comfort her.</p>
<p class="text-left">After that she went away.</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">Peter had a hard time looking out for her.</p>
<p class="text-left">The goats were even worse, and only by shouting and whistling( 吹口哨 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">especially by swinging( 挥 ) his rod( 杆 ), could he drive them together.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Heidi, where are you now?” he called quite angrily.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Here,” it sounded from somewhere.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter could not see her, for she was sitting on the ground behind a little hill, which was covered with fragrant( 芳香的 ) flowers.</p>
<p class="text-left">The whole air was filled with their smell, and the child drew it in, in long breaths( 呼吸 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Follow me now!” Peter called out.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The grandfather has told me to look out for you, and you must not fall over the rocks.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Where are they?” asked Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Way up there, and we have still far to go.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you come quickly, we may see the eagle( 鹰 ) there and hear him scream( 发出尖锐的声音 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">That got Heidi’s attention, and she came running to Peter, with her apron( 围裙 ) full of flowers.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You have enough now,” he said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If you pick them all today, there won’t be any left tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi admitted( 承认 ) that, and from now on she stayed at Peter’s side.</p>
<p class="text-left">After they had reached their destination( 目的地 ), the boy took off his bag, putting it in a little hollow( 低洼处 ) in the ground.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he lay down in the sunny grass, for he was very tired.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi, taking off her apron, rolled( 卷 ) it together and put it beside Peter’s bag.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then, sitting down beside the boy, she looked around her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Far down she saw the bright valley( 山谷 ); a large field of snow rose high in front of her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi sat a long time without moving, with Peter asleep by her side and the goats climbing about between the bushes( 灌木丛 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly she heard a loud, high scream, and looking up she saw the largest bird she had ever seen flying above her.</p>
<p class="text-left">With wings spreading wide, he flew in large circles over Heidi’s head.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Wake up, Peter!” Heidi called.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Look up, Peter, and see the eagle there!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter got wide wake, and then they both watched the bird breathlessly( 屏息地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It rose higher and higher into the blue sky, till it disappeared at last behind the mountain peak( 山顶 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Where has it gone?” Heidi asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Home to its nest( 巢 ),” was Peter’s answer.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, let’s climb up there and see its nest!” said Heidi,</p>
<p class="text-left">but Peter, expressing decided disapproval( 反对 ) in his voice, answered:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh dear, not even goats could climb up there!</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandfather has told me not to let you fall down the rocks, so we can’t go!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter now began to call loudly and to whistle, and soon all the goats gathered( 集合 ) together on the green field.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi ran into the middle of them, for she loved to see them jumping and playing about.</p>
<p class="text-left">At the same time, Peter was preparing lunch for Heidi and himself.</p>
<p class="text-left">He put her large pieces on one side and his own small ones on the other.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he milked Bärli and put the full bowl in the middle.</p>
<p class="text-left">When he was ready, he called to the little girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">But it took some time before she obeyed his call.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Stop jumping, now,” said Peter,</p>
<p class="text-left">“and sit down; your lunch is ready.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is this milk for me?” she asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, it is; those large pieces also belong to( 属于 ) you.</p>
<p class="text-left">When you are through with the milk, I’ll get you some more.</p>
<p class="text-left">After that I’ll get mine.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“What milk do you get?” Heidi asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I get it from my own goat. But go ahead and eat!” Peter commanded( 命令 ) again.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi obeyed, and when the bowl was empty, he filled it again.</p>
<p class="text-left">Breaking off a piece of bread for herself, she gave Peter the rest, which was still bigger than his own piece.</p>
<p class="text-left">She also handed him the whole slice( 片 ) of cheese, saying:</p>
<p class="text-left">“You can eat that, I have had enough!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter was speechless with surprise, for it would have been impossible for him ever to give up any of his share.</p>
<p class="text-left">Not taking Heidi seriously, he doubted till she put the things on his knees.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he saw she really meant it, and he seized( 抓住 ) his prize.</p>
<p class="text-left">Nodding his thanks to her, he ate the best meal he had ever had in all his life.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was watching the goats, and asked Peter for their names.</p>
<p class="text-left">The boy could tell them all to her, for their names were about the only thing he had to carry in his head.</p>
<p class="text-left">She soon knew them, too.</p>
<p class="text-left">One of them was the Big Turk, who tried to stick his big horns( 角 ) into all the others.</p>
<p class="text-left">Most of the goats ran away from that rough( 粗野的 ) comrade( 伙伴 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The brave Thistlefinch alone was not afraid.</p>
<p class="text-left">A small, white goat, called Snowhopper, kept making sounds in the saddest way, which made Heidi comfort it several times.</p>
<p class="text-left">Throwing her arms around its head, she asked,</p>
<p class="text-left">“What is the matter with you, Snowhopper? Why do you always cry for help?”</p>
<p class="text-left">The little goat pressed close to Heidi’s side and became perfectly quiet.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter was still eating, but between the swallows( 吞咽 ) he called to Heidi:</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is so unhappy, because the old goat was sold to somebody in Mayenfeld two days ago.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Who was the old goat?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Her mother, of course.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Poor little Snowhopper!” said Heidi, drawing the little creature( 生物 ) lovingly to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Don’t be sad anymore;</p>
<p class="text-left">see, I am coming up with you every day now, and if there is anything the matter, you can come to me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Snowhopper pressed her head against Heidi’s shoulder and stopped making any sound.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Peter had finally finished his lunch, he joined Heidi.</p></div>

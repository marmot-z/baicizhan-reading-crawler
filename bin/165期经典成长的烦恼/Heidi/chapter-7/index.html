                        <div><p class="text-left">The little girl had just been observing( 发现 ) that Schwänli and Bärli were by far the cleanest and prettiest of the goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">She mentioned it to Peter, who replied:</p>
<p class="text-left">“I know! Of course they are the prettiest, because the uncle washes them and gives them salt.</p>
<p class="text-left">He has the best goat shed( 棚 ) by far.”</p>
<p class="text-left">All of a sudden, Peter, who had been lying on the ground, jumped up and ran after the goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi, knowing that something must have happened, followed him.</p>
<p class="text-left">She saw him running to a dangerous cliff( 悬崖 ) on the side of the mountain.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter had noticed how Thistlefinch had gone nearer and nearer to the dangerous spot( 地点 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He only just came in time to prevent( 防止 ) the goat from falling down over the very edge.</p>
<p class="text-left">After he led back the goat with Heidi’s help and had the goat in safety, he raised his rod( 杆 ) to beat it for punishment.</p>
<p class="text-left">The goat stepped back shyly, for it knew what was coming.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi screamed( 尖叫 ) loudly:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Peter, no, do not beat him! Look how scared( 害怕的 ) he is.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“He well deserves( 应得 ) it,” shouted Peter, ready to strike.</p>
<p class="text-left">But Heidi seized( 抓住 ) his arms and shouted, full of anger about this unfairness:</p>
<p class="text-left">“You mustn’t hurt him! Let him go!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi’s eyes were shining,</p>
<p class="text-left">and when he saw her with her commanding( 威严的 ) expression, he stopped and dropped his rope.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’ll let him go, if you give me a piece of your cheese( 奶酪 ) again tomorrow,” he said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You may have it all tomorrow and every day, because I don’t need it,” Heidi said to him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I shall also give you a big piece of bread, if you promise never to beat any of the goats.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t care,” said Peter, and in that way he gave his promise.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thus the day had passed, and the sun was already sinking down( 下沉 ) behind the mountains.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sitting on the grass, Heidi looked at the flowers that were shining in the last light of the sun.</p>
<p class="text-left">The peaks( 山顶 ) also started to shine, and Heidi suddenly called to the boy:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Peter, look! Everything is on fire.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you see the mountains all lit up?</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, how beautiful the snow looks!</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter, the eagle’s nest( 巢 ) is surely on fire, too.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, look at the fir( 冷杉 ) trees over there!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter was quietly pulling pieces off his rod.</p>
<p class="text-left">Looking up, he said to Heidi:</p>
<p class="text-left">“This is no fire; it always looks like that.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But what is it then?” asked Heidi eagerly( 热切地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“It gets that way of itself,” explained Peter.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, see, how beautiful!</p>
<p class="text-left">It looks as if many, many roses were growing on those cliffs.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, now they are getting gray.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh dear! The fire has gone out and it is all over.</p>
<p class="text-left">What a terrible shame!” said Heidi quite sadly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It will be the same again tomorrow,” Peter told her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come now, we have to go home.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When Peter had called the goats together, they started on their way down.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Will it be like that every day when we are up?” asked Heidi, eagerly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It usually is,” was the reply.</p>
<p class="text-left">That made Heidi feel happy again.</p>
<p class="text-left">At last, reaching the hut, they found the grandfather waiting for them on a bench( 长凳 ) under the fir trees.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi ran up to him and the two goats followed, for they knew their master( 主人 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter called to her:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come again tomorrow! Good night!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi ran quickly back to Peter and gave him her hand, telling him that she would come.</p>
<p class="text-left">Finding herself in the middle of the group of goats, she hugged( 拥抱 ) Snowhopper a last time.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Peter had disappeared, Heidi returned to her grandfather.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh grandfather! It was so beautiful!</p>
<p class="text-left">I saw the fire and the roses on the rocks!</p>
<p class="text-left">And see the many, many flowers I am bringing you!”</p>
<p class="text-left">With that Heidi shook them out of her apron( 围裙 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">But oh, how miserable( 悲惨的 ) they looked!</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi did not even know them anymore.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What is the matter with them, grandfather?</p>
<p class="text-left">They looked so different!” Heidi shouted in her fright( 惊恐 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“They are made to bloom( 绽放 ) in the sun and not to be shut up in an apron,” said the grandfather.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Then I shall never pick them anymore!</p>
<p class="text-left">Please, grandfather, tell me why the eagle screams so loudly,” asked Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Because he is laughing at the people down below, who sit in the villages and make each other angry.</p>
<p class="text-left">He calls down to them:</p>
<p class="text-left">‘If you would go apart to live up on the heights like me, you would feel much better!’ ”</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather said these last words with such a wild voice, that it reminded Heidi of the eagle’s scream.</p>
<p class="text-left">The child told him about the wonderful fire.</p>
<p class="text-left">She asked how it came about.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The sun does it,” he said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Saying good night to the mountains, the sun throws his most beautiful light to them,</p>
<p class="text-left">that they may not forget him till the morning.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was so much pleased with this explanation that she could hardly wait to see the sun say good night again.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was time now to go to bed, and Heidi slept soundly( 熟睡地 ) all night.</p>
<p class="text-left">She dreamed that the little Snowhopper was jumping happily about on the shining mountains with many beautiful roses blooming round her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Next morning Peter came again with his goats, and Heidi went up to the pasture( 牧场 ) with them.</p>
<p class="text-left">This happened day after day, and in this healthy life Heidi grew stronger.</p>
<p class="text-left">Soon the autumn came and when the wind was blowing across the mountains,</p>
<p class="text-left">the grandfather would say:</p>
<p class="text-left">“You must stay home today, Heidi;</p>
<p class="text-left">for the wind can blow such a little thing as you down into the valley.”</p></div>

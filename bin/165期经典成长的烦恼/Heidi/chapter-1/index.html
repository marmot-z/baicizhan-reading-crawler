                        <div><p class="text-left">Heidi</p>
<p class="text-left">The little old town of Mayenfeld is beautifully situated.</p>
<p class="text-left">A footpath leads to the foot of the heights, which look down upon the valley( 山谷 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">One bright sunny morning in June, a tall, strong woman climbed up the path( 小路 ), leading a little girl by the hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">The youngster’s cheeks( 脸颊 ) were in such a glow( 脸上的红光 ) that it showed even through her sun-browned skin.</p>
<p class="text-left">Despite the heat, the five-year-old was dressed as if she had to brave a cold winter.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her shape was difficult to see, for she wore two dresses, perhaps three, and a large red cotton( 棉布 ) scarf around her shoulders.</p>
<p class="text-left">Wearing heavy boots( 靴子 ), this hot and shapeless( 没形状的 ) little person worked hard to get up the mountain.</p>
<p class="text-left">The pair had been climbing for about an hour when they reached a village halfway up the great mountain named the Alm.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was the elder girl’s hometown, and therefore she was greeted( 收到问候 ) from nearly every hut( 小屋 );</p>
<p class="text-left">people called to her from windows and doors, and very often from the road.</p>
<p class="text-left">But the girl did not hang around on her way and only stood still when she reached the end of the village.</p>
<p class="text-left">There stood a few cottages( 乡间小屋 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">A voice called out from the furthest one through an open door:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Deta, please wait one moment! I am coming with you, if you are going further up.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When the girl stood still to wait, the child instantly( 立即 ) let go of her hand and quickly sat down on the ground.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are you tired, Heidi?” Deta asked the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">“No, but hot,” she replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“We shall be up in an hour, if you take big steps and climb with all your little might!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Thus the elder girl tried to encourage her small companion( 同伴 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">A strong, pleasant-looking woman stepped out of the hut and joined the two.</p>
<p class="text-left">The child had risen and wandered( 漫步 ) behind the old friends.</p>
<p class="text-left">Deta and the other girl immediately started talking about their friends in the neighborhood and the people of the village.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Where are you taking the child, Deta?” asked Barbara, the newcomer.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is she the child your sister left?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” Deta told her,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am taking her up to the Alm-Uncle and I want her to remain there.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You can’t really mean to take her there Deta.</p>
<p class="text-left">You must have lost your senses.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am sure the old man will show you the door and won’t even listen to what you say.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why not?</p>
<p class="text-left">As he’s her grandfather, it is high time he should do something for the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have taken care of her until this summer and now a good place has been offered to me.</p>
<p class="text-left">The child shall not stop me from accepting it!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“It would not be so hard, if he were like other people.</p>
<p class="text-left">But you know him yourself.</p>
<p class="text-left">How could he look after a child, especially such a little one?</p>
<p class="text-left">She’ll never get along with him, I am sure of that!—But tell me of your plans.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am going to a splendid( 华丽的 ) hut in Frankfurt( 地名，法兰克福 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Last summer some people went off to the Baths and I took care of their rooms.</p>
<p class="text-left">As they got to like me, they wanted to take me along, but I could not leave.</p>
<p class="text-left">They have come back now and have persuaded( 说服 ) me to go with them.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am glad I am not the child!” shouted Barbara shakily.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Nobody knows anything about the old man’s life up there.</p>
<p class="text-left">He doesn’t speak to a living soul( 活人 ), and from one year’s end to the other he keeps away from church.</p>
<p class="text-left">People get out of his way when he appears once a year down here among us.</p>
<p class="text-left">When he wanders along the road with his stick, we are all afraid to meet him alone.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“That is not my fault( 错 ),” said Deta stubbornly( 倔强地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“He won’t do her any harm; and if he should, he is responsible( 负有责任的 ), not I.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I wish I knew what goes on in the old man’s mind.</p>
<p class="text-left">Why are his eyes so fierce( 凶猛的 ) and why does he live up there all alone?</p>
<p class="text-left">Nobody ever sees him and we hear many strange things about him.</p>
<p class="text-left">Didn’t your sister tell you anything, Deta?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Of course she did, but I shall hold my tongue( 默不作声 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He would make me pay for it if I didn’t.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Barbara had long been anxious( 急切的 ) to know something about the old uncle and why he lived apart from everybody.</p>
<p class="text-left">Nobody had a good word for him, and when people talked about him, they did not speak openly as if they were afraid.</p>
<p class="text-left">She could not even explain why he was called the Alm-Uncle.</p>
<p class="text-left">He could not possibly be the uncle of all the people in the village.</p>
<p class="text-left">But since everybody called him so, she did the same.</p>
<p class="text-left">Barbara, who had only lived in the village since her marriage, was glad to get some information from her friend.</p>
<p class="text-left">Deta had grown up there, but had gone away to earn her own income( 谋生 ) since her mother’s death.</p>
<p class="text-left">She confidentially( 悄悄地 ) seized( 抓住 ) Deta’s arm and said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I wish you would tell me the truth about him, Deta;</p>
<p class="text-left">you know it all—people only gossip( 说长道短 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Tell me, what has happened to the old man to turn everybody against him so?</p>
<p class="text-left">I promise I will keep things to myself!”</p></div>

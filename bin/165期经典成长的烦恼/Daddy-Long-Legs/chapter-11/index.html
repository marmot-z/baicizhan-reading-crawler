                        <div><p class="text-left">I started to tell you about the campus( 校园 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I wish you’d come for a little visit and let me walk you about and say:</p>
<p class="text-left">“That is the library. The building on your left is the gymnasium( 体育馆 ), and the one beside it is the new infirmary( 医务室 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, I’m good at showing visitors around.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve done it all my life at the Home, and I’ve been doing it all day here.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have, really.</p>
<p class="text-left">And he was a Man, too!</p>
<p class="text-left">That’s a new experience for me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I never talked to a man before (except occasional Trustees( 董事 ), and they don’t count).</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m sorry, Daddy, I don’t mean to hurt your feelings( 感情 ) when I say bad things about the Trustees.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t feel you are really one of them.</p>
<p class="text-left">You just ended up on the Board by chance.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Trustee, as such, is fat and self-satisfied. He pats( 拍 ) one on the head and wears a gold watch.</p>
<p class="text-left">That looks like a June bug( 鳃金龟 ), but is meant to be a picture of any Trustee except you.</p>
<p class="text-left">However—to continue:</p>
<p class="text-left">I have been walking and talking and having tea with a man.</p>
<p class="text-left">And with a very good type of man—with Mr. Jervis Pendleton of the House of Julia.</p>
<p class="text-left">He’s her uncle, and he’s as tall as you.</p>
<p class="text-left">Since he was in town on business, he decided to come out to the college and call on his niece( 侄女 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He’s her father’s youngest brother, but she doesn’t know him very well.</p>
<p class="text-left">It seems he took one look at her when she was a baby, decided he didn’t like her, and has never noticed her since.</p>
<p class="text-left">Anyway, there he was, sitting in the reception( 接待 ) room, looking very proper with his hat and stick and gloves beside him.</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia and Sallie had seventh-period classes that they couldn’t miss.</p>
<p class="text-left">So Julia ran into my room and begged( 请求 ) me to walk him about the campus and then bring him to her when the seventh period was over.</p>
<p class="text-left">I said I would, but not with much enthusiasm( 热情 ), because I don’t care much for Pendletons.</p>
<p class="text-left">But he turned out to be a very sweet man.</p>
<p class="text-left">He’s a real human being—not a Pendleton at all. We had a beautiful time; I’ve longed for an uncle ever since.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you mind pretending( 假装 ) you’re my uncle?</p>
<p class="text-left">I believe they’re even better than grandmothers.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Pendleton reminded( 使....记起 ) me a little of you, Daddy, as you were twenty years ago.</p>
<p class="text-left">You see I know you well, even if we haven’t ever met!</p>
<p class="text-left">He’s tall and rather thin, with a funny smile that keeps wanting to come out but never quite does.</p>
<p class="text-left">And he has a way of making you feel, from the very beginning, as though you’d known him a long time.</p>
<p class="text-left">We walked all over the campus, after which he said he felt weak and must have some tea.</p>
<p class="text-left">He suggested that we go to College Inn( 旅馆 )—it’s just outside the campus, by a pleasant walk through the pine( 松树 ) trees.</p>
<p class="text-left">I said we ought to go back for Julia and Sallie.</p>
<p class="text-left">But he said he didn’t like to have his nieces drink too much tea; it made them nervous.</p>
<p class="text-left">So we just ran away and had tea and muffins( 松饼 ) and ice cream( 冰激凌 ) and cake at a nice little table outside.</p>
<p class="text-left">The inn was quite conveniently( 赶巧地 ) empty, since this is the end of the month and the students have mostly spent all their money.</p>
<p class="text-left">We had a great time!</p>
<p class="text-left">But he had to hurry to catch his train as soon as he got back, and he hardly saw Julia at all.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was very angry with me for taking him away.</p>
<p class="text-left">It seems he’s an unusually rich and desirable uncle.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was happy to find out that he is rich, because the tea and things cost sixty cents each.</p>
<p class="text-left">This morning (It’s Monday now) three boxes of chocolates came by express mail( 特快邮件 ) for Julia and Sallie and me.</p>
<p class="text-left">What do you think of that?</p>
<p class="text-left">I have been given chocolates by a man!</p>
<p class="text-left">I begin to feel like a girl instead of an Orphan( 孤儿 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I wish you’d come and have tea some day and let me see if I like you.</p>
<p class="text-left">But wouldn’t it be dreadful( 糟糕的 ) if I didn’t?</p>
<p class="text-left">However, I know I should.</p>
<p class="text-left">Love,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left"></p>
<p class="text-left">June 9th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Happy day!</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve just finished my last examination—Physiology( 生理学 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">And now:</p>
<p class="text-left">Three months on a farm!</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t know what a farm is.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve never been on one in my life.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve never even looked at one (except from the car window).</p>
<p class="text-left">But I know I’m going to love it, and I’m going to love being free.</p>
<p class="text-left">Even now, I’m not used to being outside the John Grier Home.</p>
<p class="text-left">Whenever I think of it, I am afraid.</p>
<p class="text-left">I feel as though I must run faster and faster and keep looking over my shoulder, to make sure that Mrs. Lippett isn’t after me, reaching out with her arm to take me back.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t have to take care of anyone this summer, do I?</p>
<p class="text-left">Your power over me doesn’t scare( 使…害怕 ) me in the least; you are too far away to do any harm.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Lippett is dead forever( 永远地 ), so far as I am concerned, and the people on the farm aren’t expected to supervise( 监督 ) my morals( 道德 ), are they?</p>
<p class="text-left">No, I am sure they aren’t.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am entirely grown up.</p>
<p class="text-left">I leave you now to pack( 打包 ) my things away.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p></div>

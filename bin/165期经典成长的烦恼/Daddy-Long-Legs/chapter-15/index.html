                        <div><p class="text-left">We talked a lot about the Semples, and the horses and cows and chickens.</p>
<p class="text-left">All the horses that he used to know are dead, except Grover, who was a baby at the time of his last visit.</p>
<p class="text-left">And poor Grove now is so old he can only limp( 跛行 ) about the field.</p>
<p class="text-left">He asked if they still kept doughnuts( 甜甜圈 ) in a yellow pot( 锅 ) with a blue plate( 盘子 ) over it—and they do!</p>
<p class="text-left">He wanted to know if there was still a woodchuck’s hole under the heap( 许多 ) of rocks—and there is!</p>
<p class="text-left">Amasai caught a big, fat, grey one there this summer, the twenty-fifth great-grandson of the one Master( 老爷 ) Jervis caught when he was a little boy.</p>
<p class="text-left">I called him “Master Jervie” to his face, but he didn’t appear to be insulted( 受侮辱的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia says she has never seen him so friendly; he’s usually pretty unapproachable.</p>
<p class="text-left">But Julia hasn’t a bit of tact( 乖巧 ), and men, I find, require a great deal.</p>
<p class="text-left">They purr( 发出呼噜声 ) if you rub( 抚摸 ) them the right way and spit( 吐口水 ) if you don’t.</p>
<p class="text-left">(That isn’t a very elegant metaphor( 高雅的比喻 ). I don’t mean literally( 确确实实地 ), of course)</p>
<p class="text-left">How heavy the rain is!</p>
<p class="text-left">We shall have to swim to chapel( 小教堂 ) tonight.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">Jan. 20th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Did you ever have a sweet baby girl who was stolen when she was a baby?</p>
<p class="text-left">Maybe I am that baby girl!</p>
<p class="text-left">If we were in a novel( 小说 ), that is how it would end, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s strange not to know what one is—sort of exciting and romantic( 浪漫的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">There are such a lot of possibilities.</p>
<p class="text-left">Maybe I’m not American; lots of people aren’t.</p>
<p class="text-left">I may be descended( 是...的后裔 ) from the ancient Romans( 古罗马帝国 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I may be a Viking’s daughter, or I may be the child of a Russian exile( 流亡者 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Or maybe I’m a Gipsy—I think perhaps I am.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have a very wandering( 跳跃的 ) spirit, though I haven’t as yet had much chance to develop it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you know about the time I ran away from the Home because they punished me for stealing cookies?</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s down in the books free for any Trustee to read.</p>
<p class="text-left">But really, Daddy, what could you expect?</p>
<p class="text-left">They made a hungry little nine-year girl clean knives all day, with the cookie jar( 罐 ) next to her, and then went away and left her alone.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you suddenly returned, wouldn’t you expect to find a few cookie crumbs( 碎屑 ) around her mouth?</p>
<p class="text-left">And then they hit me on the side of the head and told all the other children that it’s because I was a thief( 贼 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Wouldn’t you expect me to run away?</p>
<p class="text-left">I only ran four miles.</p>
<p class="text-left">They caught me and brought me back; and every day for a week I was tied, like a naughty( 淘气的 ) dog, to a stick in the back yard, while the other children were allowed out to play.</p>
<p class="text-left">Goodbye, my dear Daddy.</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S. There’s one thing I’m perfectly sure of—I’m not Chinese.</p>
<p class="text-left">February 4th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Jimmie McBride has sent me a Princeton banner( 旗帜 ) as wide as my room.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am very grateful( 感激的 ) to him for remembering me, but I don’t know what on earth to do with it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie and Julia won’t let me hang it up; our room this year is furnished( 被装修 ) in red, and you can imagine how strange it would look if I added orange and black.</p>
<p class="text-left">But it’s such nice, warm, thick cloth( 布料 ), I hate to waste it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Would it be very wrong to have it made into a dressing gown( 礼服 )?</p>
<p class="text-left">My old one doesn’t fit any more.</p>
<p class="text-left">I know I’m supposed to tell you what I’ve been learning, and I haven’t.</p>
<p class="text-left">But though you might not imagine it from my letters, my time is very much taken up with study.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s a very confusing( 令人困惑的 ) thing to get educated in five subjects at once.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The test of true learning,” says the Chemistry Professor( 教授 ), “is attention to detail( 细节 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Be careful not to keep your eyes glued to detail,” says History Professor.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Stand far enough away to get an understanding of the whole.”</p>
<p class="text-left">You can see how carefully we have to change our methods between chemistry and history classes.</p>
<p class="text-left">I like the historical method best.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I say that William the Conqueror( 征服者威廉 ) came over in 1492, and Columbus discovered America in 1100 or 1066 or whenever it was, that’s a mere detail that the Professor does not care about.</p>
<p class="text-left">It gives a feeling of security and restfulness to the history class, that is entirely lacking in chemistry.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sixth-period bell—I must go to the laboratory and learn about chemical compounds( 化合物 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Examinations next week, but who’s afraid?</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">March 5th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">There is a March wind blowing, and the sky is filled with heavy, black moving clouds.</p>
<p class="text-left">The crows( 乌鸦 ) in the trees are making such a noise!</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s an intoxicating( 令人陶醉的 ), exciting, calling noise.</p>
<p class="text-left">You want to close your books and be off over the hills to race with the wind.</p>
<p class="text-left">We had a paper chase( 撒纸追逐赛 ) last Saturday over five miles of muddy( 泥泞的 ) woods and fields.</p>
<p class="text-left">We didn’t get back to college till half past six—half an hour late for dinner.</p>
<p class="text-left">We went straight in to dinner without changing our clothes, and with our appetites( 食欲 ) unaffected( 不受影响的 ) by everything we had eaten!</p>
<p class="text-left">Then none of us went to chapel—our excuse was that our boots( 靴子 ) were too dirty!</p>
<p class="text-left">I never told you about examinations.</p>
<p class="text-left">I passed everything easily—I know the secret now, and am never going to fail again.</p>
<p class="text-left">I shan’t be able to graduate( 毕业 ) with honors( 荣誉 ) though, because of those Latin( 拉丁文 ) and geometry( 几何学 ) exams in my first year.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I don’t care.</p>
<p class="text-left">What’s the difference, as long as you’re happy?</p>
<p class="text-left">Speaking of classics, have you ever read “Hamlet”?</p>
<p class="text-left">If you haven’t, do it at once.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s great. I’ve been hearing about Shakespeare all my life, but I had no idea he really wrote so well.</p>
<p class="text-left">I always thought he was going largely on his reputation( 名声 ).</p></div>

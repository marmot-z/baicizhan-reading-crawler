                        <div><p class="text-left">When Sara entered the classroom the next morning everybody looked at her with interested eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">By that time every pupil had heard a great deal about her.</p>
<p class="text-left">There was Lavinia Herbert, who was nearly thirteen and felt quite grown up, as well as Lottie Legh, who was only just four and the baby of the school.</p>
<p class="text-left">They knew that she was Miss Minchin’s show pupil.</p>
<p class="text-left">Lavinia had passed by Sara’s room when the door was open.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had seen Mariette, Sara’s French maid, opening a box which had arrived late from the shop.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It was full of dresses with expensive lace on them,” she whispered to her friend Jessie as she studied her geography.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I heard Miss Minchin say to Miss Amelia that her clothes were so grand that they were silly for a child.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara was sitting in her seat, waiting to be told what to do.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had been placed near Miss Minchin’s desk.</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked back quietly at the children who looked at her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She wondered what they were thinking of, and if they liked Miss Minchin, and if any of them had a papa at all like her own.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had had a long talk with Emily about her papa that morning.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He is on the sea now, Emily,” she had said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“We must be very great friends to each other.</p>
<p class="text-left">Emily, look at me.</p>
<p class="text-left">You have the nicest eyes I ever saw—but I wish you could speak.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She was a child full of imagination, and one of her favorite things was pretending( 假装 ) that Emily was alive and really heard and understood.</p>
<p class="text-left">After Mariette had dressed her in her dark blue classroom dress, she went to Emily, who sat in a chair of her own.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara gave her a book.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You can read that while I am downstairs( 在楼下 ),” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">Seeing Mariette looking at her curiously, she spoke to her with a serious little face.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What I believe about dolls,” she said, “is that they can do things they will not let us know about.</p>
<p class="text-left">Perhaps, really, Emily can read and talk and walk, but she will only do it when people are out of the room. That is her secret.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Mariette liked this unusual little girl who had such an intelligent small face and such perfect manners.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had taken care of children who were not so polite before.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara was a very fine person.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had a gentle way of saying, “If you please, Mariette,” “Thank you, Mariette,” which was very pleasant.</p>
<p class="text-left">Indeed, Mariette was very much pleased with her new little employer and liked her place greatly.</p>
<p class="text-left">After Sara had sat in her seat in the classroom for a few minutes, Miss Minchin knocked in a serious manner upon her desk.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Young ladies,” she said, “I wish to introduce you to your new companion, Miss Crewe.</p>
<p class="text-left">She has just come to us from a great distance—from India.</p>
<p class="text-left">As soon as lessons are over you must introduce yourselves.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Sara,” said Miss Minchin in her classroom manner, “come here to me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She had taken a book from the desk and was turning over its leaves.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara went to her politely.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Your papa has chosen a French maid for you,” she began.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Therefore, I conclude( 推断 ) that he wishes you to make a special study of the French language.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara felt a little awkward( 尴尬的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“I think he chose her,” she said, “because he—he thought I would like her, Miss Minchin.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am afraid,” said Miss Minchin, with a slightly sour smile, “that you have been a very spoiled little girl, and always imagine that things are done because you like them.</p>
<p class="text-left">My impression is that your papa wished you to learn French.”</p>
<p class="text-left">If Sara had been older or less careful about being quite polite to people, she could have explained herself in a very few words.</p>
<p class="text-left">But, as it was, she felt color rising in her cheeks.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin was a very serious and frightening person.</p>
<p class="text-left">She seemed so sure that Sara knew nothing of French that Sara felt as if it would be almost rude to correct her.</p>
<p class="text-left">The truth was that Sara could not remember the time when she had not seemed to know French.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her father had often spoken it to her when she had been a baby.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her mother had been a French woman, and Captain Crewe had loved her language.</p>
<p class="text-left">So Sara had always heard and understood it.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I—I have never really learned French, but—but—” she began, trying shyly to make herself clear.</p>
<p class="text-left">One of Miss Minchin’s chief secret annoyances( 烦恼 ) was that she did not speak French herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That is enough,” she said with polite bitterness.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If you have not learned, you must begin at once.</p>
<p class="text-left">The French master, Monsieur Dufarge, will be here in a few minutes.</p>
<p class="text-left">Take this book and look at it until he arrives.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara’s cheeks felt warm.</p>
<p class="text-left">She went back to her seat and opened the book.</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked at the first page with a stony face.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin looked toward her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You look rather cross( 生气的 ), Sara,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am sorry you do not like the idea of learning French.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am very fond of it,” answered Sara, thinking she would try again, “but—”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You must not say ‘but’ when you are told to do things,” said Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Look at your book again.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And Sara did so.</p>
<p class="text-left">“When Monsieur Dufarge comes,” she thought, “I can make him understand.”</p></div>

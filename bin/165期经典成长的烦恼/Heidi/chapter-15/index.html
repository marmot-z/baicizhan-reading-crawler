                        <div><p class="text-left">Heidi really needed some clothes, so Clara had given her some.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Miss Rottenmeier was just busy arranging( 整理 ) the child’s wardrobe( 衣橱 ), she suddenly returned to the study, where the two children stayed.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Adelheid,” she said hatefully,</p>
<p class="text-left">“What do I find? A big pile of( 一大堆 ) bread in your wardrobe! I never heard the like. Yes, Clara, it is true.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she ordered to take away the bread and the old hat she had found.</p>
<p class="text-left">“No, don’t! I must keep my hat! The bread is for grandmother,” cried Heidi in despair( 绝望地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“You stay here, while we take the rubbish away,” said the lady decidedly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi threw herself down on Clara’s chair and sobbed( 啜泣 ) as if her heart would break.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now I can’t bring grandmother any rolls( 面包卷 )! Oh, they were for grandmother!” she cried sadly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Heidi, don’t cry anymore,” Clara begged( 乞求 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Listen! When you go home someday( 某天 ), I am going to give you as many rolls as you had, and more.</p>
<p class="text-left">They will be much softer and better than those ones you have kept.</p>
<p class="text-left">Those were not fit to eat, Heidi. Stop now, please, and don’t cry anymore!”</p>
<p class="text-left">At supper( 晚餐 ), Heidi’s eyes were swollen( 肿的 ) and it was still hard for her to keep from crying.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sebastian made strange signs to her that she did not understand. What did he mean?</p>
<p class="text-left">Later, though, when she climbed into her high bed, she found her old hat that she loved so much hidden under her cover.</p>
<p class="text-left">So Sebastian had saved it for her and had tried to tell her!</p>
<p class="text-left">She held it close to her and was very happy.</p>
<p class="text-left">She hid it in the furthest corner of her wardrobe.</p>
<p class="text-left">A few days afterward( 之后 ) there was great excitement in the Sesemann house, for the master( 主人 ) of the house had just arrived.</p>
<p class="text-left">The servants were taking upstairs( 上楼 ) one load( 袋 ) after another, for Mr. Sesemann always brought many lovely things home with him.</p>
<p class="text-left">When he entered his daughter’s room, Heidi shyly retreated into( 退到 ) a corner.</p>
<p class="text-left">He greeted( 向...问好 ) Clara lovingly, and she was equally delighted( 高兴的 ) to see him, for she loved her father dearly.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the dining room he found Miss Rottenmeier surveying the table with a most tragic( 悲惨的 ) face.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You do not look very happy at my arrival, Miss Rottenmeier. What is the matter? Clara seems well enough,” he said to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Mr. Sesemann, we have been terribly disappointed( 失望的 ),” said the lady.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What do you mean?” asked Mr. Sesemann, drinking his wine calmly( 平静地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“We had decided, as you know, to have a companion( 同伴 ) for Clara.</p>
<p class="text-left">Knowing that you would wish me to get a noble( 贵族的 ), pure( 纯洁的 ) child, I thought of this Swiss( 瑞士的 ) child.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have been terribly disappointed, for this child has brought the most frightful( 吓人的 ) animals into the house.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Candidate can tell you!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“The child does not look very terrible. But what do you mean?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I cannot explain it, because she does not seem in her right mind at times.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann was getting worried at last, and decided to talk to his daughter.</p>
<p class="text-left">He found the children in the study.</p>
<p class="text-left">Turning to Heidi, who had risen at his approach, he said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come, little one, get me—get me a glass of water.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Fresh water?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Of course, fresh water,” he replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Heidi had gone, he sat down near Clara, holding her hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Tell me, little Clara,” he asked,</p>
<p class="text-left">“please tell me clearly what animals Heidi has brought into the house;</p>
<p class="text-left">is she really not right in her mind?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara now began to relate to her father all the incidents( 事件 ) with the kittens( 小猫 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann laughed a lot and asked Clara if she wished Heidi to remain.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Of course, Papa. Since she is here, something amusing( 好笑的 ) happens every day;</p>
<p class="text-left">it used to be so dull( 无聊的 ), but now Heidi keeps me company.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Very good, very good, Clara; Oh! Here is your friend back again.</p>
<p class="text-left">Did you get nice fresh water?” asked Mr. Sesemann.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi handed him the glass and said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, fresh from the fountain( 喷泉 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You did not go to the fountain yourself, Heidi?” said Clara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Certainly, but I had to get it from far, there were so many people at the first and at the second fountain.</p>
<p class="text-left">I had to go down another street and there I got it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara’s father laughed.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the evening, Mr. Sesemann told Miss Rottenmeier that Heidi was going to remain,</p>
<p class="text-left">for the children were very fond of( 喜欢 ) each other and he found Heidi normal( 正常的 ) and very sweet.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I want the child to be treated kindly,” Mr. Sesemann added decidedly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Her strange characteristics( 性格 ) must not be punished.</p>
<p class="text-left">My mother is coming very soon to stay here, and she will help you to manage the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">There is nobody in this world that my mother could not get along with, as you know, Miss Rottenmeier.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Of course, I know that, Mr. Sesemann,” replied the lady, but she was not very much pleased at the idea of Mrs. Sesemann coming over.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann only stayed two weeks, for his business called him back to Paris( 巴黎，地名 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He consoled( 安抚 ) his daughter by telling her that his mother was coming in a very few days.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann had hardly left, when the grandmother’s visit was announced( 宣告 ) for the following day.</p></div>

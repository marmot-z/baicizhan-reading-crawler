                        <div><p class="text-left">“Sit down, Jerusha, I have something to say to you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha dropped into the nearest chair and waited anxiously( 不安地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">A car passed quickly by the window, and Mrs. Lippett turned to look at it.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Did you notice the gentleman who has just gone?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I saw his back.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“He is one of our most generous( 慷慨的 ) Trustees( 董事 ), and has given large amounts of money to support our work.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am not allowed to tell you his name.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was very clear that he wished to remain unknown.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha’s eyes widened slightly.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was not used to being called to the office to discuss the strange behavior( 行为 ) of Trustees with the matron( 女总管 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“This gentleman has taken an interest in several of our boys.</p>
<p class="text-left">You remember Charles Benton and Henry Freize?</p>
<p class="text-left">They were both sent through college by Mr. —by this Trustee. Both have repaid( 回报 ), with their hard work and success, the money that was so generously spent on them.</p>
<p class="text-left">The gentleman does not wish for any other payment.</p>
<p class="text-left">Up till now, his generosity has been directed towards the boys only.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have never been able to interest him in any of our girls, no matter how deserving( 值得的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He does not care for girls.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No, ma’am,” Jerusha replied, since some reply seemed to be expected at this point.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Today at our meeting, the question of your future was discussed.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Lippett was silent for a moment, then continued in a slow, quiet manner that only made Jerusha’s nervousness worse.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Usually, as you know, the children are not kept after they are sixteen, but an exception was made in your case.</p>
<p class="text-left">You finished our school at fourteen.</p>
<p class="text-left">You have done very well in your studies—though your behavior has not always been what it should be.</p>
<p class="text-left">So we decided to let you go to the village high school.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now you are finishing that, and of course we can no longer support you.</p>
<p class="text-left">As it is, you have had two years more than most.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Lippett did not mention the fact that Jerusha had worked hard for her food and her room during those two years.</p>
<p class="text-left">Nor that the convenience( 方便 ) of the Orphans’ Home( 孤儿院 ) had always come first and her education second, and that on days like this one, she had to miss school to help out at the Home.</p>
<p class="text-left">“As I say, the question of your future was brought up and your record was discussed—thoroughly( 深入地 ) discussed.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Lippett brought accusing( 责备的 ) eyes to bear upon the prisoner( 犯人 ) in the dock( 被怀疑做了坏事 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The prisoner looked guilty( 愧疚的 ) because it seemed to be expected—not because she could remember any strikingly black pages in her record.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Of course, normally( 正常来说 ) we would place you in a position where you could begin to work.</p>
<p class="text-left">But you have done well in school in certain subjects.</p>
<p class="text-left">It seems that your work in English has even been brilliant( 优秀的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Pritchard, who is on our visiting committee( 委员会 ), is also on the school board.</p>
<p class="text-left">She has been talking with your English teacher, and made a speech in your favor.</p>
<p class="text-left">She also read aloud an essay( 论文 ) that you had written called, ‘Blue Wednesday.’ ”</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha’s guilty expression this time was quite genuine( 真实的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“It seemed to me that you were very rude( 无礼的 ) in making fun of the Home that has done so much for you.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you had not managed to be funny, I doubt if you would have been forgiven( 被原谅 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">But fortunately( 幸运的 ) for you, Mr. —, that is, the gentleman who has just gone—appears to have an over-developed sense of humor.</p>
<p class="text-left">On the strength of that ungrateful( 不知感激的 ) paper, he has offered to send you to college.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“To college?” Jerusha’s eyes grew big.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. Lippett nodded.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He waited to discuss the terms with me.</p>
<p class="text-left">They are unusual.</p>
<p class="text-left">The gentleman, I may say, is a little unusual himself.</p>
<p class="text-left">He believes that you have originality, and he is planning to educate you to become a writer.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“A writer?” Jerusha could only repeat Mrs. Lippett’s words.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That is his wish.</p>
<p class="text-left">Whether anything will come of it, the future will show.</p>
<p class="text-left">All your fees will be paid directly to the college.</p>
<p class="text-left">During the four years you are there, you also will receive an allowance( 零用钱 ) of thirty-five dollars a month.</p>
<p class="text-left">This is to allow you to live a similar life to the other students.</p>
<p class="text-left">In my opinion, for a girl who has never had any experience in handling( 处理 ) money, it is too much.</p>
<p class="text-left">But that is his plan, and I did not feel free to make any suggestions.</p>
<p class="text-left">You are to remain here through the summer, and Miss Pritchard has kindly agreed to make sure you have clothes suitable( 合适的 ) for college.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The money will be sent to you by the gentleman’s private secretary once a month.</p>
<p class="text-left">In return, you will write a letter once a month.</p>
<p class="text-left">In this letter you are not to thank him for the money.</p>
<p class="text-left">He doesn’t care to have that mentioned.</p>
<p class="text-left">But you are to write a letter telling of your progress in your studies and the details( 细节 ) of your daily life.</p>
<p class="text-left">It should be the kind of letter that you would write to your parents, if you had any.</p></div>

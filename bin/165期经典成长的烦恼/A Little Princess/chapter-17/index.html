                        <div><p class="text-left">She spoke slowly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her imagination was beginning to work for her.</p>
<p class="text-left">It had not worked for her at all since her troubles had come upon her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had felt as if it had been blocked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Other people have lived in worse places.</p>
<p class="text-left">Think of the people in the Bastille!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“The Bastille,” half whispered Ermengarde, watching her and beginning to be interested.</p>
<p class="text-left">She remembered stories of the French Revolution which Sara had told her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” she said, hugging her knees, “that will be a good place to pretend about.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am a prisoner in the Bastille.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have been here for years and years, and everybody has forgotten about me.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin is the jailer( 狱卒 )—and Becky is the prisoner in the next cell( 牢房 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">She turned to Ermengarde, looking quite like the old Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I shall pretend that,” she said, “and it will be a great comfort.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde was filled with wonder.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And will you tell me all about it?” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“May I secretly come up here at night, and hear the things you have made up in the day?</p>
<p class="text-left">It will seem as if we were more ‘best friends’ than ever.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” answered Sara, nodding.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Hard times try people, and mine have tried you and shown how nice you are.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Lottie was much confused by the change she saw in her young adopted mother.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had heard that strange things had happened to Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">She could not understand, however, why Sara looked different.</p>
<p class="text-left">Why did she wear an old black dress and only come into the classroom to teach?</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are you very poor now, Sara, like a beggar?” she had asked secretly the first morning her friend took charge of the French class.</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked at Sara with sad eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t want you to be poor as a beggar.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked as if she was going to cry.</p>
<p class="text-left">And Sara hurriedly comforted her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Beggars have nowhere to live,” she said courageously.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have a place to live.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Where do you live?” Lottie asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The new girl sleeps in your room.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I live in another room,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is it a nice one?” Lottie kept asking.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I want to go and see it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You must not talk,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Miss Minchin is looking at us.</p>
<p class="text-left">She will be angry with me for letting you whisper.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She knew that she was to be held accountable for everything which was objected to.</p>
<p class="text-left">If the children were not paying attention, if they talked, if they were restless, it was she who would be blamed.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Sara came back to her attic that day, she stood in the middle of it and looked about her.</p>
<p class="text-left">The bed was hard and covered with its old blanket.</p>
<p class="text-left">The white wall showed its broken areas, the floor was cold and empty, and the broken footstool was the only seat in the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">She sat down on it for a few minutes and let her head drop in her hands.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s a lonely place,” she said. “Sometimes it’s the loneliest place in the world.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She was sitting in this way when her attention was attracted by a slight sound near her. She lifted her head to see where it came from.</p>
<p class="text-left">If she had been a nervous child, she would have left her seat on the footstool in a hurry.</p>
<p class="text-left">A large rat was sitting up on his back legs and sniffing( 嗅 ) the air.</p>
<p class="text-left">Some crumbs had dropped upon the floor and their smell had drawn him out of his hole.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara was rather interested in this gray little animal.</p>
<p class="text-left">He looked at her with his bright eyes, as if he were asking a question.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It must be rather hard to be a rat,” she thought.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Nobody likes you. People jump and run away and scream out, ‘oh, an awful rat!’</p>
<p class="text-left">I wouldn’t like it if people screamed and jumped and said, ‘Oh, an awful Sara!’ the moment they saw me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She had sat so quietly that the rat had begun to take courage.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was very hungry.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had a wife and a large family in the wall, and they had had bad luck for several days.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had left the children crying, and felt he would risk a good deal for a few crumbs, so he carefully dropped upon his feet.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come on,” said Sara; “I’m not a trap.</p>
<p class="text-left">You can have them, poor thing!</p>
<p class="text-left">Prisoners in the Bastille used to make friends with rats.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suppose I make friends with you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">He was really a very nice rat, and did not mean the least harm.</p>
<p class="text-left">He went softly toward the crumbs and began to eat them.</p>
<p class="text-left">As he did it he looked every now and then at Sara, and his expression was so sorry that it touched her heart.</p>
<p class="text-left">She sat and watched him without making any movement.</p>
<p class="text-left">One crumb was very much larger than the others—in fact, it could hardly be called a crumb.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was evident that he wanted that piece very much, but it lay quite near the footstool and he was still rather shy.</p>
<p class="text-left">The rat came a little nearer and ate a few more crumbs.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he stopped and sniffed, giving a side look at Sara on the footstool.</p>
<p class="text-left">He moved quickly at the piece, and the second he had taken it, ran back to the wall.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he slipped down into an opening, and was gone.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I do believe I could make friends with him,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I will call him Melchisedec.”</p></div>

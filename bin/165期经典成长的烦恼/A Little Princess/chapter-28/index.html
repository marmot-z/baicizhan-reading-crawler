                        <div><p class="text-left">The dream was quite at an end.</p>
<p class="text-left">The table was left empty, and the golden plates and beautiful napkins were changed back into old handkerchiefs and pieces of paper.</p>
<p class="text-left">Emily was sitting with her back against the wall.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara saw her, and went and picked her up with shaking hands.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There isn’t any meal left, Emily,” Sara said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And there isn’t any princess. There is nothing left but the prisoners in the Bastille.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And she sat down and hid her face.</p>
<p class="text-left">What would have happened if she had not hidden her face just then, and if she had chanced to look up at the skylight at that moment, I do not know.</p>
<p class="text-left">Perhaps the end of this chapter might have been quite different.</p>
<p class="text-left">If she had looked at the skylight, she would certainly have been surprised by what she would have seen.</p>
<p class="text-left">She would have seen exactly the same face pressed against the glass.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was looking in at her as it had looked in earlier in the evening when she had been talking to Ermengarde.</p>
<p class="text-left">But she did not look up.</p>
<p class="text-left">She sat with her little black head in her arms for some time.</p>
<p class="text-left">She always sat like that when she was trying to bear something in silence.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she got up and went slowly to the bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I can’t pretend anything else—while I am awake,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There wouldn’t be any use in trying.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I go to sleep, perhaps a dream will come and pretend for me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She suddenly felt so tired—perhaps through want of food—that her eyes closed and she fell fast asleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not know how long she slept.</p>
<p class="text-left">But she had been tired enough to sleep deeply—too deeply to be troubled by anything.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she awakened it was rather suddenly, and she did not know that any particular thing had called her out of her sleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">The truth was, however, that it was a sound which had called her back—a real sound.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was the click of the skylight as it closed after a white figure went through it and hid close by.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was just near enough to see what happened in the attic, but not near enough to be seen.</p>
<p class="text-left">At first she did not open her eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">She felt too sleepy and—strangely enough—too warm and comfortable.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was so warm and comfortable, indeed, that she did not believe she was really awake.</p>
<p class="text-left">It felt like a lovely dream.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What a nice dream!” she whispered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I feel quite warm. I—don’t—want—to—wake—up.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Of course it was a dream.</p>
<p class="text-left">She felt as if warm, fine bedclothes( 卧具 ) were covering her.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she put out her hand, it touched something exactly like a very soft and warm blanket.</p>
<p class="text-left">She must not awaken from this delight—she must be quite still and make it last.</p>
<p class="text-left">But she could not—even though she kept her eyes closed tightly, she could not. Something was forcing her to awaken—something in the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a sense of light, and a sound—the sound of a strong little fire.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, I am awakening,” she said sadly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I can’t help it—I can’t.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Her eyes opened even though she did not want them to.</p>
<p class="text-left">And then she actually smiled—for what she saw she had never seen in the attic before, and knew she never should see.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, I haven’t awakened,” she whispered, rising on her arm to look all about her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am dreaming yet.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She knew it must be a dream, for if she were awake such things could not—could not be.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you wonder why she felt sure she had not come back to earth?</p>
<p class="text-left">This is what she saw.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the fireplace there was a warm fire.</p>
<p class="text-left">On the hob( 铁架 ) was a little kettle( 壶 ) boiling. Spread upon the floor was a thick, warm dark red carpet.</p>
<p class="text-left">Before the fire there was a chair, with pillows on it.</p>
<p class="text-left">By the chair stood a small table, covered with a white cloth, and spread with small covered dishes, a cup, a saucer( 茶托 ), and a teapot( 茶壶 ) upon it.</p>
<p class="text-left">On the bed were new warm blankets; at the foot lay a silk robe( 长袍 ), a pair of warm slippers( 拖鞋 ), and some books.</p>
<p class="text-left">The room of her dream seemed changed into fairyland( 仙境 )—and it was filled with warm light, for a bright lamp stood on the table covered with a pink shade.</p>
<p class="text-left">She sat up, resting on her arm, and her breathing became short and fast.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It does not—disappear,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, I never had such a dream before.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not want to move, but at last she pushed the blankets away, and put her feet on the floor with a wide smile.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am dreaming—I am getting out of bed,” she heard her own voice say.</p>
<p class="text-left">And then, as she stood up in the middle of it all, turning slowly from side to side—“I am dreaming it stays—real!</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m dreaming it feels real.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s magical—or I’m magical.</p>
<p class="text-left">I only think I see it all.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Her words began to hurry themselves.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If I can only keep on thinking it,” she cried, “I don’t care! I don’t care!”</p>
<p class="text-left">She stood a moment longer, and then cried out again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, it isn’t true!” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It can’t be true! But oh, how true it seems!”</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">“You have made him angry!” said Heidi, angrily.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He won’t be mad long. But come now!” asked Deta.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I won’t come,” Heidi replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What?” Deta said in a heated way.</p>
<p class="text-left">But changing her voice, she continued in a more friendly manner:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come now; you don’t understand me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am taking you to the most beautiful place you have ever seen.”</p>
<p class="text-left">After packing up( 把...打包 ) Heidi’s clothes she said again,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come, child, and take your hat.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Don’t be stupid. Listen to me.</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandfather is sending us away and we must do what he commands( 命令 ), or he will get more angry still.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Can I come home again tonight?” asked Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come now. If you don’t like it, you can come back.</p>
<p class="text-left">If we get to Mayenfeld today, we can take the train tomorrow.</p>
<p class="text-left">That will make you fly home again in the shortest time!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Holding the clothes, Deta led the child down the mountain.</p>
<p class="text-left">On their way they met Peter, who had not gone to school that day.</p>
<p class="text-left">The boy thought it was more useful to spend his time looking for rods( 杆 ) than to learn to read.</p>
<p class="text-left">After all, he always needed the rods.</p>
<p class="text-left">When he caught sight of Heidi and Deta, he asked them where they were going.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am going to Frankfurt with Aunt Deta,” Heidi replied;</p>
<p class="text-left">“but first I must see grandmother, for she is waiting.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh no, it is too late. You can see her when you come back,” said Deta, pulling Heidi along with her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was afraid that the old woman might keep the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter ran into the cottage( 乡间小屋 ) and hit the table with his rods.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmother jumped up in her fright( 害怕 ) and asked him what that meant.</p>
<p class="text-left">“They have taken Heidi away,” Peter said angrily.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Who has, Peter? Where has she gone?” the unhappy grandmother asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">Brigida had seen Deta walking up the footpath a short while ago and soon they guessed what had happened.</p>
<p class="text-left">With a trembling( 颤抖的 ) hand, the old woman opened a window and called out as loudly as she could:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Deta, Deta, don’t take the child away. Don’t take her from us.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When Heidi heard that, she struggled( 挣扎 ) to get free, and said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I must go to grandmother; she is calling me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">But Deta would not let her go.</p>
<p class="text-left">She urged( 敦促 ) her on by saying that she might return soon again.</p>
<p class="text-left">She also suggested that Heidi might bring a lovely present to the grandmother when she came back.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi liked this prospect( 可能性 ) and followed Deta without trying to stay.</p>
<p class="text-left">After a while she asked:</p>
<p class="text-left">“What shall I bring to the grandmother?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You might bring her some soft white rolls( 面包卷 ), Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think the black bread is too hard for poor grandmother to eat.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, I know, aunt, she always gives it to Peter,” Heidi confirmed( 证实 ) her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“We must go quickly now;</p>
<p class="text-left">we might get to Frankfurt today and then I can be back tomorrow with the rolls.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was running now, and Deta had to follow.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was glad enough to escape( 逃避 ) the questions that people might ask her in the village.</p>
<p class="text-left">People could see that Heidi was pulling her along, so she said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I can’t stop. Don’t you see how the child is hurrying?”</p>
<p class="text-left">whenever she heard from all sides:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are you taking her with you?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is she running away from the uncle?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“What a wonder she is still alive!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“What red cheeks( 脸颊 ) she has!” and so on.</p>
<p class="text-left">Soon they had left the village far behind them.</p>
<p class="text-left">From that time on, the uncle looked more angry than ever when he came to the village.</p>
<p class="text-left">Everybody was afraid of him, and the women would warn their children to keep out of his sight.</p>
<p class="text-left">He hardly ever came down, only to sell his cheese( 奶酪 ) and buy his provisions.</p>
<p class="text-left">Often people remarked( 说 ) how lucky it was that Heidi had left him.</p>
<p class="text-left">They had seen her hurrying away, so they thought that she had been glad to go.</p>
<p class="text-left">The old grandmother alone continued to support him.</p>
<p class="text-left">Whenever anybody came up to her, she would tell them what good care the old man had taken of Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">She also told them that he had mended( 修补 ) her little house.</p>
<p class="text-left">These reports reached the village, of course, but people only half believed them.</p>
<p class="text-left">She began her days with sighing( 叹息 ) again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“All happiness has left us with the child. The days are so long and boring.</p>
<p class="text-left">If only I could hear Heidi’s voice before I die.”</p>
<p class="text-left">the poor old woman would say, day after day.</p>
<p class="text-left">In a beautiful house in Frankfurt lived a sick child by the name of Clara Sesemann.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was sitting in a comfortable wheelchair, which could be pushed from room to room.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara spent most of her time in the study, where long rows of bookcases( 书架 ) lined the walls.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara had a pale, thin face with soft blue eyes, which at that moment were watching the clock impatiently( 不耐烦地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">At last she said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh Miss Rottenmeier, isn’t it time yet?”</p>
<p class="text-left">The lady so addressed was the housekeeper( 管家 ), who had lived with Clara since Mrs. Sesemann’s death.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara’s father was away from home a great deal, leaving the entire management of the house to the lady.</p>
<p class="text-left">While Clara was waiting, Deta had arrived with Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">Following the maid( 女仆 ), they found themselves in the study.</p>
<p class="text-left">Deta held on to Heidi’s hand and stayed near the door.</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">“The man will be himself again in three weeks,” Mr. Carmichael said quietly to his wife.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Look at his face already.”</p>
<p class="text-left">In fact, he did look changed.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had new things to think of and plan for already.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the first place, there was Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">She must be told of the change which had taken place in the fortunes of her pupil.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara was not to return to the school.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Indian gentleman was very determined upon that point.</p>
<p class="text-left">She must remain where she was, and Mr. Carmichael should go and see Miss Minchin himself.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am glad I need not go back,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She will be very angry. She does not like me, though perhaps it is my fault, because I do not like her.”</p>
<p class="text-left">But, strangely enough, Miss Minchin made it unnecessary for Mr. Carmichael to go to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She came in search of her pupil herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had wanted Sara for something, and when she asked where Sara was, she had heard a very surprising thing.</p>
<p class="text-left">One of the housemaids had seen her steal out of the area with something hidden under her coat.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had also seen her go up the steps of the next door and enter the house.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What does she mean!” cried Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She must have been in the house for two hours.</p>
<p class="text-left">I shall go and look into the matter.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara was sitting on a footstool close to Mr. Carrisford’s knee when Ram Dass announced the visitor’s arrival.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara rose suddenly, and became rather pale, but Mr. Carrisford saw that she showed none of the ordinary signs of child fear.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin entered the room with a serious manner.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was well dressed, and polite.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am sorry to trouble Mr. Carrisford,” she said, “but I have explanations to make.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am Miss Minchin, the head of the Young Ladies’ School next door.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The Indian gentleman looked at her for a moment.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was a man who had naturally a rather hot temper( 脾气 ), and he did not wish it to get too much the better of him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“So you are Miss Minchin?” he said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am, sir.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“In that case,” the Indian gentleman replied, “you have arrived at the right time. My lawyer, Mr. Carmichael, was just on the point of going to see you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Carmichael bowed slightly, and Miss Minchin looked from him to Mr. Carrisford in surprise.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Your lawyer!” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I do not understand.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have come here because I have just discovered that you have been troubled by one of my pupils—a charity pupil.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She turned upon Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Go home at once,” she commanded.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You shall be greatly punished. Go home at once.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The Indian gentleman drew Sara to his side and took her hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is not going.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin felt as if she must be losing her senses.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Not going!” she repeated.</p>
<p class="text-left">“No,” said Mr. Carrisford.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is not going home—if you give your house that name. Her home for the future will be with me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin fell back in confusion.</p>
<p class="text-left">“With you, sir! What does this mean?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Kindly explain the matter, Carmichael,” said the Indian gentleman.</p>
<p class="text-left">He made Sara sit down again, and held her hands in his—just like her papa would do.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Mr. Carrisford, madam,” Carmichael said, “was a close friend of the late Captain Crewe.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was his partner in certain large investments( 投资 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The fortune which Captain Crewe supposed he had lost has been recovered, and is now in Mr. Carrisford’s hands.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“The fortune!” cried Miss Minchin, and she really lost her color as she said it.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Sara’s fortune!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is Sara’s fortune,” replied Mr. Carmichael, rather coldly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Certain events have increased it enormously.</p>
<p class="text-left">The diamond mines have recovered themselves.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“The diamond mines!” Miss Minchin cried out.</p>
<p class="text-left">If this was true, nothing so awful, she felt, had ever happened to her since she was born.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The diamond mines,” Mr. Carmichael repeated.</p>
<p class="text-left">He could not help adding, with a little smile, “There are not many princesses, Miss Minchin, who are richer than your little charity pupil, Sara Crewe, will be.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Carrisford has been searching for her for nearly two years; he has found her at last, and he will keep her.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin was not a clever woman.</p>
<p class="text-left">In her excitement she was silly enough to make one last effort to get back what she had lost through her foolishness( 愚蠢 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“He found her under my care,” she argued.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But for me she should have starved in the streets.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Here the Indian gentleman lost his temper.</p>
<p class="text-left">“As to starving in the streets,” he said, “she might have starved more comfortably there than in your attic.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Captain Crewe left her in my charge,” Miss Minchin argued.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She must return to it until she is of age.</p>
<p class="text-left">She must finish her education.</p>
<p class="text-left">The law will support my claim.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come, come, Miss Minchin,” Mr. Carmichael interrupted, “the law will do nothing of the sort.</p>
<p class="text-left">If Sara herself wishes to return to you, I should say Mr. Carrisford might not refuse.</p>
<p class="text-left">But that rests with Sara.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Then,” said Miss Minchin, “I ask Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have not spoiled you, perhaps,” she said awkwardly to the little girl, “but you know that your papa was pleased with your progress.</p>
<p class="text-left">And—ahem( 呃哼 )—I have always been fond of you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara’s green-gray eyes fixed themselves on her with the quiet, clear look Miss Minchin particularly disliked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Have you, Miss Minchin?” she said. “I did not know that.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin reddened.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You ought to have known it,” said she, “but children, unfortunately, never know what is best for them.</p>
<p class="text-left">Amelia and I always said you were the cleverest child in the school.</p>
<p class="text-left">Will you not do your duty to your poor papa and come home with me?”</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">About a week later, Mr. Candidate asked to see Mrs. Sesemann, to tell her of something unusual that had occurred( 发生 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">With many more words the happy grandmama was told that Heidi had suddenly learned to read.</p>
<p class="text-left">She read with the utmost( 最大的 ) correctness, most rare( 稀罕的 ) with beginners.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Many strange things happen in this world,” Mrs. Sesemann remarked( 说 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">while they went over to the study to witness( 见证 ) Heidi’s new achievement.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was sitting close to Clara, reading her a story;</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi seemed amazed( 吃惊的 ) at the strange, new world that had opened up before her.</p>
<p class="text-left">At supper( 晚餐 ), Heidi found the large book with the beautiful pictures on her plate( 盘子 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Looking doubtfully at grandmama, she saw the old lady nod.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now it belongs to( 属于 ) you, Heidi,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Forever( 永远 )? Also when I am going home?” Heidi asked, confused( 疑惑的 ) with joy( 欢乐 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Certainly, forever!” the grandmama told her. “Tomorrow we shall begin to read it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi still looked at her book before going to bed that night, and this book became her dearest treasure.</p>
<p class="text-left">She would look at the beautiful pictures and read all the stories aloud to Clara.</p>
<p class="text-left">Since Heidi had learned to read and possessed( 拥有 ) the book, the days seemed to fly.</p>
<p class="text-left">The time had come near that the grandmama would leave.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmama sent for Heidi every day after dinner, while Clara was resting and Miss Rottenmeier disappeared into her room.</p>
<p class="text-left">Often Heidi would read to the old lady, for the more often she read over the stories, the dearer they became to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">But she never looked really cheerful and her eyes never shone happily as before.</p>
<p class="text-left">The day of departure( 离开 ) had come, but Mrs. Sesemann arranged( 整理 ) everything in such a way that the children hardly realized she was actually( 真正地 ) going.</p>
<p class="text-left">Everything was empty and quiet when she had gone, and the children hardly knew how to pass their time.</p>
<p class="text-left">Next day, Heidi came to Clara and read some story to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">But she did not get very far, for the story she was reading told of a grandmother’s death.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly she cried aloud:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, now grandmother is dead!”</p>
<p class="text-left">It seemed so real to her that she thought it was her own grandmother at home.</p>
<p class="text-left">Louder and louder she cried:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now poor grandmother is dead and I can never see her anymore; and she never got one single roll( 面包卷 )!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Rottenmeier had overheard( 偶然听到 ) the scene.</p>
<p class="text-left">She came to Heidi and said impatiently( 不耐烦地 ):</p>
<p class="text-left">“Adelheid, now you have screamed( 大声喊叫 ) enough.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I hear you again crying in such a noisy way, I shall take your book away forever!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi turned pale at that, for the book was her greatest treasure.</p>
<p class="text-left">Quickly drying her tears( 眼泪 ), she stopped crying. After that Heidi never cried again in front of the housekeeper( 管家 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">But she got more cheerless every day, and looked so thin and pale.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the evening she would cry quietly, with her heart bursting with( 充满 ) longing to go home.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thus the time passed by.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi struggled( 挣扎 ) constantly( 不断地 ) against her sorrow( 伤心 ), but in vain( 徒劳 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Autumn and winter had passed, and Heidi knew that the time was coming when Peter would go up the Alp with his goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">The flowers were shining in the sunshine and the mountains were all on fire.</p>
<p class="text-left">She would sit down in a corner of her room and put both hands before her eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">In this way, she tried not to see the sunshine on the opposite( 相反的 ) wall.</p>
<p class="text-left">There she would remain, filled with longing, till Clara would call for her to come.</p>
<p class="text-left">Something strange was happening in the house.</p>
<p class="text-left">Every morning, when the servants came downstairs( 下楼 ), they found the front door wide open.</p>
<p class="text-left">At first everybody had thought that the house must have been robbed( 遭窃 ), but nothing was missing.</p>
<p class="text-left">Every morning it was the same, despite the double locks that were put on the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">At last Sebastian and one of the other servants prepared themselves to watch through a night to see who the ghost( 鬼 ) was.</p>
<p class="text-left">They went to a room downstairs, where they first talked, but soon, getting sleepy, they rested silently in their chairs.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the clock from the old church tower struck one, Sebastian awoke and awakened his friend, which was no easy matter.</p>
<p class="text-left">At last, however, the servant was wide awake, and together they went out into the hall.</p>
<p class="text-left">The same moment a strong wind put out the light that the servant held in his hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">Rushing back, he nearly walked into Sebastian, who stood behind him.</p>
<p class="text-left">Pulling the butler( 男管家 ) back into the room, he locked the door quickly.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the light was lit again, Sebastian noticed that the servant was deadly pale and trembling( 摇晃 ) like a leaf.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sebastian, not having seen anything, asked anxiously( 焦急地 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">“What is the matter? What did you see?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“The door was open and a white form was on the stairs( 楼梯 ); it went up and was gone in a moment,”</p>
<p class="text-left">said the servant breathlessly( 气喘吁吁地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Cold shivers( 冷颤 ) ran down Sebastian’s back.</p>
<p class="text-left">They sat without moving till the morning came, and then, shutting( 关 ) the door,</p>
<p class="text-left">They went upstairs( 上楼 ) to report to Miss Rottenmeier what they had seen.</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">Ram Dass came up through his attic window and crossed to hers as steadily( 稳步地 ) and lightly as if he had walked on roofs all his life.</p>
<p class="text-left">He went through the skylight and dropped upon his feet without a sound.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he turned to Sara and bowed to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">The monkey saw him and gave a little scream.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ram Dass quickly closed the skylight, and then went to catch him.</p>
<p class="text-left">It did not take very long.</p>
<p class="text-left">The monkey made it last a few minutes evidently for the mere fun of it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Presently he sprang on to Ram Dass’s shoulder and sat there hanging onto his neck with a little skinny arm.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ram Dass thanked Sara deeply.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had seen that his quick eyes had taken in at a look all the emptiness( 空旷 ) of the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">He spoke to her, however, as if he were speaking to the little daughter of a king, and pretended that he saw nothing.</p>
<p class="text-left">He did not remain more than a few moments after he had caught the monkey.</p>
<p class="text-left">His master, who was ill, was sometimes amused( 被逗笑 ) by the animal, Ram Dass explained.</p>
<p class="text-left">He would have been made sad if his favorite had run away and been lost.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he bowed once more and got through the skylight and across the roof again.</p>
<p class="text-left">When he had gone, Sara stood in the middle of her attic.</p>
<p class="text-left">She thought of many things his face and his manner had brought back to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">The sight of his clothing and the seriousness of his manner awoke all her past memories( 记忆 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It seemed strange that only a few years ago, she had servants who treated her as Ram Dass had treated her.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was like a sort of dream.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was all over, and it could never come back.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then a thought came back to her, which made the color rise in her face and a light shine in her eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">She straightened her thin little body and lifted her head.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Whatever comes,” she said, “cannot change one thing.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I am a princess in rags and worn out clothes, I can be a princess inside.</p>
<p class="text-left">It would be easy to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold. It is a great deal more of a victory to be one all the time when no one knows it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">This was not a new thought, but quite an old one, by this time.</p>
<p class="text-left">It had comforted her through many a difficult day.</p>
<p class="text-left">The morning after the interview with Ram Dass and his monkey, Sara was in the classroom with her small pupils.</p>
<p class="text-left">Having finished giving them their lessons, she was putting the French exercise books together.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was also thinking of the various things royal people in disguise( 伪装 ) were called upon to do.</p>
<p class="text-left">Alfred the Great( 阿尔弗雷德大帝 ), for instance, after burning some cakes, got his ears boxed by the wife of the shepherd( 牧人 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">How frightened the wife must have been when she found out what she had done.</p>
<p class="text-left">If Miss Minchin should find out that she—Sara, whose toes( 脚趾 ) were almost sticking out of her boots—was a princess—a real one!</p>
<p class="text-left">The look in Sara’s eyes was exactly the look which Miss Minchin most disliked.</p>
<p class="text-left">She would not have it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Since Miss Minchin was angry and standing quite close to Sara, she actually flew at her and boxed her ears.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was exactly like the shepherd’s wife who had boxed King Alfred’s.</p>
<p class="text-left">It made Sara start.</p>
<p class="text-left">She wakened from her dream at the surprise.</p>
<p class="text-left">Catching her breath, she stood still a second.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then, not knowing she was going to do it, she broke into a little laugh.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What are you laughing at, you rude child?” Miss Minchin cried out.</p>
<p class="text-left">It took Sara a few seconds to control herself enough to remember that she was a princess.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I was thinking,” she answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Beg my pardon immediately,” said Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara stopped a second before she replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I will beg your pardon for laughing, if it was rude,” she said then, “but I won’t beg your pardon for thinking.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“What were you thinking?” demanded Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“How dare you think? What were you thinking?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Jessie and Lavinia laughed quietly together.</p>
<p class="text-left">All the girls looked up from their books to listen.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I was thinking,” she answered politely, “that you did not know what you were doing.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“That I did not know what I was doing?” Miss Minchin asked with surprise.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” said Sara. “I was thinking what would happen if I were a princess and you boxed my ears—what I should do to you.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was thinking how surprised and frightened you would be if you suddenly found out—”</p>
<p class="text-left">“What?” she asked. “Found out what?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“That I really was a princess,” said Sara, “and could do anything—anything I liked.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Every pair of eyes in the room widened to its full limit.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Go to your room,” cried Miss Minchin, breathlessly, “this instant! Leave the classroom! Attend( 专心 ) to your lessons, young ladies!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara made a little bow.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Excuse me for laughing if it was improper,” she said, and walked out of the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin was left struggling with her anger, and the girls whispered over their books.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Did you see her? Did you see how strange she looked?” Jessie broke out.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I shouldn’t be at all surprised if she did turn out to be something.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suppose she should!”</p></div>

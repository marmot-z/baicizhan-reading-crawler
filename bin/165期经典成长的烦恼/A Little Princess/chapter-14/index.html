                        <div><p class="text-left">And as she stood there breathless, there fell upon her ears a burst of voices from the party in her own room.</p>
<p class="text-left">She could at least stop this.</p>
<p class="text-left">But as she started toward the door, it was opened by Miss Amelia.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she caught sight of her sister’s angry face, she fell back a step in alarm.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What is the matter, sister?” she cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin’s voice was fierce when she answered:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Where is Sara Crewe?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Amelia was confused.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Sara!” she said with surprise.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why, she’s with the children in your room, of course.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Does she have a black dress in her grand wardrobe?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No—ye-es!” Miss Amelia said with uncertainty.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But it is too short for her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She has only the old black velvet, and it is too small for her.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Go and tell her to put the black one on, whether it is too short or not.</p>
<p class="text-left">She has done with nice things!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then Miss Amelia began to cry.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, sister!” she said. “What has happened?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin wasted no words.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Captain Crewe is dead,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He has died without a penny.</p>
<p class="text-left">That spoiled child is left a beggar on my hands.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Hundreds of pounds have I spent on these silly presents for her.</p>
<p class="text-left">And I shall never see a penny of it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Put a stop to this ridiculous party of hers.</p>
<p class="text-left">Go and make her change her dress at once.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I?” asked Miss Amelia.</p>
<p class="text-left">“M-must I go and tell her now?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“This moment!” was the fierce answer.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Go!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Poor Miss Amelia did not want to go into a room full of delighted children, and tell Sara that she had suddenly become a beggar.</p>
<p class="text-left">But the thing must be done.</p>
<p class="text-left">After sending Sara to her room to change her dress, Amelia returned to her sister for further instructions.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Tell Sara to come to my room,” Miss Minchin said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And explain to her that I do not want any crying.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Sister,” replied Miss Amelia, “she is the strangest child I ever saw.</p>
<p class="text-left">When I told her what had happened, she just stood quite still and looked at me without making a sound.</p>
<p class="text-left">She went quite pale.</p>
<p class="text-left">When I had finished, she still stood staring.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then her chin( 下巴 ) began to shake, and she turned around and ran out of the room and upstairs.</p>
<p class="text-left">It made me feel quite strange not to be answered; you expect people will say something—whatever it is.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara had indeed run upstairs and locked her door.</p>
<p class="text-left">She walked up and down, saying over and over again to herself in a voice which did not seem her own, “My papa is dead! My papa is dead!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara already felt as if the birthday party had been a dream or a thing which had happened in the life of another little girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she came into Miss Minchin’s sitting room, her face was white and her eyes had dark rings around them.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had put on, without Mariette’s help, the black velvet dress.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was too short and tight, and her legs looked long and thin.</p>
<p class="text-left">She held Emily tightly in one arm.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Put down your doll,” said Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What do you mean by bringing her here?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No,” Sara answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I will not put her down. My papa gave her to me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She had always made Miss Minchin feel secretly uncomfortable, and she did so now.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You will have no time for dolls in future,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You will have to work and improve yourself and make yourself useful.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara kept her big, strange eyes fixed on her, and did not speak.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Everything will be very different now,” Miss Minchin said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I suppose Miss Amelia has explained matters to you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” answered Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“My papa is dead. He left me no money. I am quite poor.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You are a beggar,” said Miss Minchin, with her anger rising at the recollection( 回忆 ) of what all this meant.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It appears that you have no one to take care of you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">For a moment the thin, pale little face moved.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara again said nothing.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What are you staring at?” demanded Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you understand?</p>
<p class="text-left">I tell you that you are quite alone in the world.</p>
<p class="text-left">You have no one to do anything for you, unless I choose to keep you here out of charity( 出于仁慈 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I understand,” answered Sara, in a low voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That doll,” cried Miss Minchin, pointing to the beautiful birthday gift—“that ridiculous doll, with all her fancy things—I actually paid the bill for her!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara turned her head toward the chair.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The Last Doll,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">And her little sad voice had a strange sound.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The Last Doll, indeed!” said Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And she is mine, not yours. Everything you own is mine.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Please take it away from me, then,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I do not want it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">If she had cried and seemed frightened, Miss Minchin might almost have had more patience with her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was a woman who liked to feel her power.</p>
<p class="text-left">As she looked at Sara’s pale little firm face, she felt as if Sara was much stronger than she was.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You are not a princess any longer.</p>
<p class="text-left">Your carriage and your pony will be sent away—your maid will be asked to leave.</p>
<p class="text-left">You will wear your plainest clothes—your expensive ones no longer fit your station.</p>
<p class="text-left">You are like Becky—you must work for your living.”</p></div>

<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">I love college and I love you for sending me!</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m very, very happy, and so excited every moment that I can hardly sleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">You can’t imagine how different it is from the John Grier Home.</p>
<p class="text-left">I never dreamed there was such a place in the world.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m feeling sorry for everybody who isn’t a girl and who can’t come here.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am sure the college you went to when you were a boy couldn’t have been so nice.</p>
<p class="text-left">My room is up in a tower where they used to put sick girls so the others couldn’t catch their diseases( 疾病 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">That was before they built the new infirmary( 医务室 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">There are three other girls on the same floor of the tower.</p>
<p class="text-left">There’s a fourth-year student who wears glasses and is always asking us to please be a little quieter.</p>
<p class="text-left">And there are two other first-year students, named Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie has red hair and a turned-up nose and is quite friendly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia comes from one of the most important families in New York( 纽约，地名 ) and hasn’t noticed me yet.</p>
<p class="text-left">They share a room, and the fourth-year student and I have single rooms.</p>
<p class="text-left">Usually first-year students can’t get single rooms.</p>
<p class="text-left">There are very few single rooms, but I got one without even asking.</p>
<p class="text-left">I suppose they didn’t think it would be right to ask a properly brought-up girl to share a room with an orphan( 孤儿 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">You see there are advantages!</p>
<p class="text-left">My room is on the northwest corner, with two windows and a view.</p>
<p class="text-left">After you’ve lived in a dormitory( 宿舍 ) for eighteen years with twenty other girls, it is restful to be alone.</p>
<p class="text-left">This is the first chance I’ve ever had to get to know Jerusha Abbott.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think I’m going to like her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you think you are?</p>
<p class="text-left">Tuesday</p>
<p class="text-left">They are organizing the first-year basketball team, and there’s just a chance that I shall get in it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m little of course, but very quick and strong and tough( 结实的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">While the others are jumping about in the air, I can move in quickly under their feet and take the ball.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s fun practicing out in the athletic( 运动的 ) field in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="text-left">The trees are all red and yellow, and the air is full of the smell of burning leaves.</p>
<p class="text-left">And everybody is laughing and shouting.</p>
<p class="text-left">These are the happiest girls I ever saw—and I am the happiest of all!</p>
<p class="text-left">I meant to write a long letter and tell you all the things I’m learning. (Mrs. Lippett said you wanted to know.)</p>
<p class="text-left">But the bell for 7th period has just rung, and in ten minutes I’m due at the sports field in my exercise clothes.</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t you hope I’ll get in the team?</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours always,</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S. (9 o’clock.)</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie McBride just put her head in at my door.</p>
<p class="text-left">This is what she said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’m so homesick( 想家的 ) that I simply can’t stand it. Do you feel that way?”</p>
<p class="text-left">I smiled a little and said no: I thought I could survive( 挺过来 ) it.</p>
<p class="text-left">At least homesickness is one problem that I’ve never had!</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve never heard of anybody being homesick for an Orphans’ Home, have you?</p>
<p class="text-left">October 10th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Did you ever hear of Michelangelo( 米开朗琪罗，人名 )?</p>
<p class="text-left">He was a famous artist who lived in Italy( 意大利 ) in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p class="text-left">Everybody in English Literature( 英语文学课 ) seemed to know about him, and the whole class laughed because I thought he was an angel( 天使 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He sounds like one, doesn’t he?</p>
<p class="text-left">The trouble with college is that you are expected to know such a lot of things you’ve never learned.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s very embarrassing( 尴尬的 ) at times.</p>
<p class="text-left">But now, when the girls talk about things that I never heard of, I just keep quiet and look them up later in the encyclopedia( 百科全书 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I made an awful mistake the first day.</p>
<p class="text-left">Somebody mentioned Maurice Maeterlinck, and I asked if she was a first-year.</p>
<p class="text-left">That joke has gone all over college.</p>
<p class="text-left">But anyway, I’m just as bright in class as any of the others—and brighter than some of them!</p>
<p class="text-left">Everything in my room is brown or yellow.</p>
<p class="text-left">The walls are painted brown, and I’ve bought yellow curtains( 窗帘 ) and a dark brown wooden desk (second-hand for three dollars).</p>
<p class="text-left">Then there’s a chair and a brown carpet( 地毯 ) with an ink( 墨水 ) stain( 污渍 ) in the middle.</p>
<p class="text-left">I place the chair over the stain.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie McBride helped me choose the things.</p>
<p class="text-left">She has lived in a house all her life and knows about furniture( 家具 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">You can’t imagine what fun it is to shop and pay with a real five-dollar bill and get some change—when you’ve never had more than a few cents in your life.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thank you so much, Daddy dear, for that allowance( 零用钱 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie is the most entertaining( 有趣的 ) person in the world—and Julia Rutledge Pendleton the least.</p>
<p class="text-left">The college has given me a rather strange mixture of roommates( 室友 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie thinks everything is funny—even failing exams—and Julia is bored with everything.</p>
<p class="text-left">She never makes the slightest effort to be friendly.</p>
<p class="text-left">She believes that if you are a Pendleton, you go to Heaven( 天堂 ) because of that fact alone.</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia and I were born to be enemies.</p>
<p class="text-left">And now I suppose you’ve been waiting very impatiently( 不耐烦地 ) to hear what I am learning?</p>
<p class="text-left">Latin( 拉丁语 ): Second Punic war( 第二次布匿克战争 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Hannibal and his forces camped at Lake Trasimenus last night.</p>
<p class="text-left">They prepared an ambush( 埋伏 ) for the Romans( 罗马人 ), and a battle took place early in the morning.</p>
<p class="text-left">Romans lost.</p>
<p class="text-left">II. French: 24 pages of The Three Musketeers.</p>
<p class="text-left">III. Geometry( 几何学 ): Finished cylinders( 圆柱体 ); now doing cones( 圆锥体 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">IV. English: My style improves( 进步 ) daily in clearness( 清晰 ) and brevity( 简洁 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">V. Physiology( 生理学 ): Reached the digestive( 消化的 ) system.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours, on the way to being educated,</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S. I hope you never touch alcohol( 酒 ), Daddy? It’s really bad for your liver( 肝脏 ).</p></div>

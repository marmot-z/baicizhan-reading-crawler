                        <div><p class="text-left">The sun was just rising.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara, having just a moment ago opened her eyes, looked about her in amazement( 惊讶 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Bright sunshine danced on her bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had never slept better in all her life.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was soon awake, too, and lost no time in coming down to join Clara, who was already sitting in the sun.</p>
<p class="text-left">A cool morning wind touched their cheeks( 脸颊 ), and the smell of the fir( 冷杉 ) trees filled their lungs( 肺 ) with every breath( 呼吸 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara had never breathed such pure( 纯净的 ), cool morning air and never felt such warm, delicious sunshine on her feet and hands.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was better than she had ever dreamed.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather was just coming out of the shed( 棚 ) with two full bowls of warm, snow-white milk.</p>
<p class="text-left">Handing one to each of the children, he said to Clara,</p>
<p class="text-left">“This will do you good, little girl. It comes from Schwänli and will give you strength.”</p>
<p class="text-left">At first Clara had hesitated( 犹豫 ) a little,</p>
<p class="text-left">but when she saw that Heidi’s bowl was nearly empty already, she drank without stopping.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, how good it was! It tasted like sugar.</p>
<p class="text-left">“We’ll drink two tomorrow,” said the grandfather.</p>
<p class="text-left">After their breakfast, Peter arrived.</p>
<p class="text-left">Taking the uncle’s two goats, he started off quickly, angrily looking back now and then( 时不时地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">As Heidi had followed a little way, Peter called to her:</p>
<p class="text-left">“You must come along, Heidi.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No, but I can’t,” Heidi called back.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I won’t be able to come as long as Clara is with me.</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandfather has promised, though, to let us come up with you one day.”</p>
<p class="text-left">With those words Heidi returned to Clara, while the goatherd( 牧羊人 ) was hurrying on, angrily shaking his fists( 拳头 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The children had promised to write a letter to grandmama every day, so they immediately started on their task.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi brought out her own little chair, her school books and her papers.</p>
<p class="text-left">With the books and the papers on Clara’s lap( 大腿 ), they began to write.</p>
<p class="text-left">The morning had passed, and lunch was ready.</p>
<p class="text-left">They again ate outside, because Clara had to be in the open air all day.</p>
<p class="text-left">The afternoon was spent in the cool shadow( 树荫处 ) of the fir trees.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was not long before Peter arrived with his goats,</p>
<p class="text-left">but without even answering the girls’ friendly greeting, he disappeared quickly with an angry look on his face.</p>
<p class="text-left">While Schwänli was being milked in the shed, Clara said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Heidi, I feel as if I could not wait for my milk.</p>
<p class="text-left">Isn’t it funny? All my life I have only eaten because I had to.</p>
<p class="text-left">And now I am so hungry!”</p>
<p class="text-left">When at last the full bowls were brought by the old man,</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara eagerly drank the contents( 碗里盛的东西 ) in one time and even finished before Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Please, may I have a little more?” she asked, holding out the bowl.</p>
<p class="text-left">Nodding, much pleased, the grandfather soon refilled it.</p>
<p class="text-left">This time he also brought a slice of( 一片 ) bread with him and butter( 黄油 ) for the children.</p>
<p class="text-left">This evening Clara fell asleep the moment she lay down.</p>
<p class="text-left">Two or three days passed in this pleasant way.</p>
<p class="text-left">The next brought a surprise.</p>
<p class="text-left">Two strong porters( 门房 ) came up the Alp, each carrying on his back a fresh, white bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">They also brought a letter from grandmama.</p>
<p class="text-left">She thanked the children for their faithful( 坚持的 ) writing, and told them that the beds were meant for them.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they went to sleep that night, they found their new beds in exactly the same position as their former ones had been.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather took excellent care of his little patient.</p>
<p class="text-left">Every day he climbed around to find the best food for Schwänli, so that her milk would be extra( 额外的 ) healthy.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was the third week of Clara’s stay.</p>
<p class="text-left">Every morning after the grandfather had carried her down, he said to her,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Would my Clara try to stand a little?” Clara always sighed( 叹息 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, it hurts me so!”</p>
<p class="text-left">but he made her stand a little longer every day, though she would hold on to him.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi had told Clara over and over again of all the flowers on the pasture( 牧场 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">of the masses of golden roses and the blue flowers that covered the ground.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had just been telling it again, when a longing seized( 抓住 ) her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She jumped up and ran over to her grandfather, who was busy in his workshop( 工作间 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, grandfather,” she cried from far away,</p>
<p class="text-left">“won’t you come with us to the pasture tomorrow? Oh, it’s so beautiful up there now.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“All right, I will,” he replied;</p>
<p class="text-left">“but tell Clara that she must do something to please me;</p>
<p class="text-left">she must try to stand longer this evening for me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi merrily( 欢乐地 ) came running with her message.</p>
<p class="text-left">Of course, Clara promised, for it was her greatest wish to go up with Heidi to the pasture!</p>
<p class="text-left">When Peter returned this evening, he heard of the plan for the next day.</p>
<p class="text-left">But for answer Peter only made a low sound, nearly hitting poor Thistlefinch in his anger.</p>
<p class="text-left">The next day started cloudless and fair.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather was still with the children, when Peter came climbing up;</p>
<p class="text-left">his goats kept at a good distance from him, to get away from the rod( 杆 ), which was striking right and left.</p>
<p class="text-left">The truth was that the boy was terribly angry by the changes that had come.</p>
<p class="text-left">When he passed the hut in the morning, Heidi was always busy with the strange child, and in the evening it was the same.</p>
<p class="text-left">All summer long Heidi had not been up with him for a single time; it was too much!</p>
<p class="text-left">And today she was coming at last, but again in company with this hateful stranger.</p></div>

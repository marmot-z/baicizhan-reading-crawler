                        <div><p class="text-left">A LITTLE PRINCESS( 公主 )</p>
<p class="text-left">Once on a dark winter’s day, when the yellow fog hung thick and heavy in the streets of London, a strange-looking little girl sat in a cab with her father.</p>
<p class="text-left">She sat, leaning( 倚靠 ) against him, as she stared out of the window with an old-fashioned thoughtfulness in her big eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was such a little girl that one did not expect to see such a look on her small face.</p>
<p class="text-left">It would have been an old look for a child of twelve, and Sara Crewe was only seven.</p>
<p class="text-left">The fact was, however, that she was always dreaming and thinking strange things.</p>
<p class="text-left">At this moment she was remembering the journey she had just made from Bombay with her father, Captain Crewe.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was thinking of the big ship, of the Lascars( 东印度水手 ) passing by on it, and of the children playing about on the hot deck( 甲板 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">She was thinking of what a strange thing it was to travel so far from India.</p>
<p class="text-left">They had been in the middle of the ocean, but now they were driving through strange streets.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Papa,” she said in a low, mysterious( 神秘的 ) little voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What is it, darling?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Captain Crewe answered, looking down into her face.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What is Sara thinking of?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is this the place?” Sara whispered. “Is it, papa?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, little Sara, it is. We have reached it at last.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And though she was only seven years old, she knew that he felt sad when he said it.</p>
<p class="text-left">It seemed to her many years since he had begun to prepare her mind for “the place,” as she always called it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her mother had died when she was born, so she had never known or missed her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her young, handsome, rich, father was the only relation she had in the world.</p>
<p class="text-left">They had always been fond of each other.</p>
<p class="text-left">She only knew he was rich because she had heard people say so.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had also heard them say that when she grew up, she would be rich, too.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not know all that being rich meant.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had always lived in a beautiful house, and had been used to seeing many servants who gave her her own way in everything.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had had toys and pets and an ayah( 奶妈 ) who cared for her, and she began to understand that people who were rich had these things.</p>
<p class="text-left">That, however, was all she knew about it.</p>
<p class="text-left">During her short life only one thing had troubled her, and that thing was “the place” she was to be taken to someday.</p>
<p class="text-left">The climate of India was very bad for children.</p>
<p class="text-left">As soon as possible they were sent away from it—generally to England and to school.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had seen other children go away, and had heard their fathers and mothers talk about the letters they received from them.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had known that she would have to go also.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had been troubled by the thought that her father could not stay with her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Couldn’t you go to that place with me, papa?” she had asked when she was five years old.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But you will not have to stay for a very long time, little Sara,” he had always said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You will go to a nice house where there will be a lot of little girls, and you will play together.</p>
<p class="text-left">I will send you plenty of books.</p>
<p class="text-left">You will grow so fast.</p>
<p class="text-left">It will seem like less than a year before you are big enough and clever enough to come back and take care of me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She had liked to think of that.</p>
<p class="text-left">To keep the house for her father, to care for and spend time with him and his friends—that would be what she would like most in the world.</p>
<p class="text-left">If one must go away to “the place” in England to do it, she must make up her mind to go.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not care very much for other little girls, but if she had plenty of books she could comfort herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">She liked books more than anything else, and was, in fact, always inventing stories and telling them to herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Well, papa,” she said softly, “if we are here I suppose we must be resigned( 听天由命的 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">He laughed at her old-fashioned speech and kissed her.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was really not at all resigned himself, though he knew he must keep that a secret.</p>
<p class="text-left">His little Sara had been a great companion( 同伴 ) to him, and he felt he should be lonely without her.</p>
<p class="text-left">So he held her closely in his arms as the cab reached their destination( 目的地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a big, brick( 砖砌的 ) house in a big, dull( 沉闷的 ) square.</p>
<p class="text-left">On the front door there shone a brass plate( 黄铜名牌 ) which read:</p>
<p class="text-left">MISS MINCHIN,</p>

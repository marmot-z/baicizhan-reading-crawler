                        <div><p class="text-left">Daddy, I think that the most necessary quality for any person to have is imagination.</p>
<p class="text-left">It makes people able to put themselves in other people’s places.</p>
<p class="text-left">It makes them kind and sympathetic( 有同情心的 ) and understanding.</p>
<p class="text-left">It ought to be encouraged in children.</p>
<p class="text-left">But the John Grier Home stamped it out at once whenever it appeared.</p>
<p class="text-left">Duty was the one quality that was encouraged.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t think children ought to know the meaning of that horrible( 恐怖的 ) word.</p>
<p class="text-left">They ought to do everything from love.</p>
<p class="text-left">Wait until you see the Home for Orphans( 孤儿院 ) that I am going to be the head of!</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s my favorite game at night before I go to sleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">I plan it out to the tiniest detail( 细节 )—the meals and clothes and study and amusements( 欢乐 ) and punishments; for even my orphans are sometimes bad.</p>
<p class="text-left">But anyway, they are going to be happy.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think that everyone ought to have a happy childhood to look back upon, no matter how many troubles he or she may have when grown up.</p>
<p class="text-left">And if I ever have any children of my own, no matter how unhappy I may be, I am not going to let them have any worries until they grow up.</p>
<p class="text-left">(There goes the chapel( 小教堂 ) bell—I’ll finish this letter later).</p>
<p class="text-left">Saturday morning</p>
<p class="text-left">When I came in from laboratory this afternoon, I found a squirrel( 松鼠 ) sitting on the tea table, helping himself to almonds( 杏仁 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">These are the kind of callers we get, now that warm weather has come and the windows stay open.</p>
<p class="text-left">I haven’t mentioned any lessons lately, but we are still having them every day.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s sort of a relief( 解脱 ) though, to get away from them and discuss life in general.</p>
<p class="text-left">My discussions with you are rather one-sided, but that’s your fault( 错误 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">You are welcome to answer back any time you choose.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve been writing this letter off and on for three days, and I fear by now you must be very bored!</p>
<p class="text-left">Goodbye, nice Mr. Man,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">June 2nd</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">You will never guess the nice thing that has happened.</p>
<p class="text-left">The McBrides have asked me to spend the summer at their camp in the Adirondacks!</p>
<p class="text-left">They belong( 属于 ) to a sort of club on a lovely little lake in the middle of the woods.</p>
<p class="text-left">The members have houses made of logs( 原木 ) among the trees.</p>
<p class="text-left">They take boats out on the lake, and go on long walks to other camps.</p>
<p class="text-left">And they have dances once a week in the club house.</p>
<p class="text-left">Jimmie McBride is going to have a college friend visiting him part of the summer, so we shall have plenty of men to dance with.</p>
<p class="text-left">Wasn’t it sweet of Mrs. McBride to ask me?</p>
<p class="text-left">It seems that she liked me when I was there for Christmas.</p>
<p class="text-left">Please excuse me for sending such a short letter.</p>
<p class="text-left">It isn’t a real letter; it’s just to let you know my plans for the summer.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours happily,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">June 5th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Your secretary man has just written to me, saying that Mr. Smith prefers( 偏向 ) that I should not accept Mrs. McBride’s invitation, but should return to Lock Willow( 柳树 ) the same as last summer.</p>
<p class="text-left">Why, why, why, Daddy?</p>
<p class="text-left">You don’t understand about it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mrs. McBride does want me, really and truly.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m not the least bit of trouble in the house.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m a help.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie and I can do lots of useful things: it’s a good chance for me to look after a house.</p>
<p class="text-left">Every woman ought to understand it, and I only know about Orphans’ Homes.</p>
<p class="text-left">There aren’t any girls of our age at the camp, and Mrs. McBride wants me as a companion( 伙伴 ) for Sallie.</p>
<p class="text-left">We are planning to do a lot of reading together.</p>
<p class="text-left">We are going to read all of the books for next year’s English and sociology.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Professor( 教授 ) said it would be a great help if we would get our reading finished in the summer;</p>
<p class="text-left">and it’s so much easier to remember it if we read together and talk it over.</p>
<p class="text-left">Just to live in the same house with Sallie’s mother is an education.</p>
<p class="text-left">She’s the most interesting woman in the world; she knows everything.</p>
<p class="text-left">Think how many summers I’ve spent with Mrs. Lippett, and how grateful( 感激的 ) I’ll be for the difference.</p>
<p class="text-left">You needn’t be afraid that I’ll be crowding( 挤进 ) them.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they have a lot of company, they just put up tents( 帐篷 ) in the woods and turn the boys outside.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s going to be such a nice, healthy summer exercising out of doors every minute.</p>
<p class="text-left">Jimmie McBride is going to teach me how to ride a horse and go boating on the lake, and how to shoot and—oh, lots of things I ought to know.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s the kind of carefree( 无忧无虑的 ) time that I’ve never had.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think every girl should have it once in her life.</p>
<p class="text-left">Of course I’ll do exactly as you say, but please, please let me go, Daddy.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve never wanted anything so much.</p>
<p class="text-left">This isn’t Jerusha Abbott, the future great author, writing to you. It’s just Judy—a girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">June 9th</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. John Smith,</p>
<p class="text-left">SIR: I have received your letter, dated the 7th of this month.</p>
<p class="text-left">According to the instructions received through your secretary, I leave next Friday to spend the summer at Lock Willow Farm.</p>
<p class="text-left">I hope always to remain,</p>
<p class="text-left">(Miss) Jerusha Abbott</p></div>

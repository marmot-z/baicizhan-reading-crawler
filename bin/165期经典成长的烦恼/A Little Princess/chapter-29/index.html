                        <div><p class="text-left">The warm fire drew her to it.</p>
<p class="text-left">She sat down and held out her hands close to it—so close that the heat made her start back.</p>
<p class="text-left">“A fire I only dreamed wouldn’t be hot,” she cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">She sprang up, touched the table, the dishes, the carpet; she went to the bed and touched the blankets.</p>
<p class="text-left">She took up the soft robe and held it to her face.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s warm. It’s soft!” she almost cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s real. It must be!”</p>
<p class="text-left">She threw it over her shoulders, and put her feet into the slippers.</p>
<p class="text-left">“They are real, too. It’s all real!” she cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am not—I am not dreaming!”</p>
<p class="text-left">She ran to the books and opened the one which lay upon the top.</p>
<p class="text-left">Something was written on the first page—just a few words, and they were these:</p>
<p class="text-left">“To the little girl in the attic. From a friend.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When she saw that—wasn’t it a strange thing for her to do—she put her face down upon the page and started to cry.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t know who it is,” she said, “but somebody cares for me a little. I have a friend.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She took her candle and stole out of her own room and into Becky’s, and stood by her bedside.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Becky, Becky!” she whispered as loudly as she could risk. “Wake up!”</p>
<p class="text-left">When Becky wakened, she sat up.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her face was still red from crying.</p>
<p class="text-left">Beside her stood a little figure in a beautiful silk robe.</p>
<p class="text-left">The face she saw was a shining, wonderful thing.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Princess Sara—as she remembered her—stood at her very bedside, holding a candle in her hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come,” she said. “Oh, Becky, come!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky was too frightened to speak.</p>
<p class="text-left">She simply got up and followed her, with her mouth and eyes open, and without a word.</p>
<p class="text-left">They crossed into her room.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara shut the door gently and drew her into the warm, shining middle of things which made her hungry senses disappear.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s true! It’s true!” she cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’ve touched them all.</p>
<p class="text-left">They are as real as we are.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Magic has come and done it,</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky, while we were asleep—the Magic that won’t let those worst things ever quite happen.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Imagine, if you can, what the rest of the evening was like.</p>
<p class="text-left">How they sat by the warm fire.</p>
<p class="text-left">How they found rich, hot soup in the dishes, and sandwiches and toast and muffins( 小松饼 ) enough for both of them.</p>
<p class="text-left">The tea was so delicious that it was not necessary to pretend that it was anything but tea.</p>
<p class="text-left">They were warm and full-fed and happy.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you think,” Becky asked once, in a whisper, “do you think it could disappear, miss?</p>
<p class="text-left">Hadn’t we better be quick?”</p>
<p class="text-left">And she quickly pushed her sandwich into her mouth.</p>
<p class="text-left">“No, it won’t disappear,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am eating this muffin, and I can taste it.</p>
<p class="text-left">You never really eat things in dreams.</p>
<p class="text-left">You only think you are going to eat them.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Their sleepy comfort was a heavenly thing.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was the sleep of happy, well fed( 喂养 ) childhood.</p>
<p class="text-left">News travels fast in schools.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was quite well known in the morning that Sara Crewe was in trouble.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde was also under punishment.</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky would have been kicked out of the house, except Miss Minchin could not easily find another child helpless enough to work for so few cents a week.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin saw Sara for the first time when Sara entered the classroom to hear the little French class do its lessons.</p>
<p class="text-left">And Sara came in with a springing step and color in her cheeks.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was the most surprising thing Miss Minchin had ever known.</p>
<p class="text-left">It gave her quite a shock.</p>
<p class="text-left">What could such a thing mean?</p>
<p class="text-left">She called her at once to her desk.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You do not look as if you realize that you are in trouble,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">Imagine a child—or even a grown-up—has been well fed, gone to sleep in the middle of a fairy story, and has wakened to find it real.</p>
<p class="text-left">She then cannot be unhappy or even look as if she were.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin was almost struck silent by the look of Sara’s eyes when she made her perfectly respectful answer.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I beg your pardon, Miss Minchin,” Sara said; “I know that I am in trouble.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do not forget it. And remember you are to have no food today.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, Miss Minchin,” Sara answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">But as she turned away, she thought, “If the Magic had not saved me just in time, how terrible it would have been!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara had decided that the wonders which had happened must be kept a secret.</p>
<p class="text-left">If Miss Minchin should choose to come up to the attic again, of course all would be discovered.</p>
<p class="text-left">But it did not seem likely that she would do so for some time at least, unless she thought something strange was going on.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But whatever happens,” Sara kept saying to herself all day—“somewhere in the world there is a kind person who is my friend.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The weather was even worse this day than it had been the day before—wetter, muddier, colder.</p>
<p class="text-left">There were more errands to be done, the cook was more disagreeable, and, knowing that Sara was in trouble, she was more cruel.</p>
<p class="text-left">But Sara’s supper of the night before had given her strength, and she knew that she should sleep well and warmly.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was quite late when she was at last allowed to go upstairs.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she reached the top flight of stairs and stood before the attic door, her heart beat rather fast.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Of course it might all have been taken away,” she whispered, trying to be brave.</p>
<p class="text-left">She pushed the door open and went in.</p>
<p class="text-left">Once inside, she shut the door, and stood with her back against it, looking from side to side in wonder.</p></div>

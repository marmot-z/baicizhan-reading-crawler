<p class="text-left">Most people don’t live; they just race.</p>
<p class="text-left">They are trying to reach some distant goal( 目标 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">And they get so breathless( 气喘吁吁的 ) that they lose all sight of the beautiful country they are passing through.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then before they know it, they are old and worn out, and it doesn’t make any difference whether they’ve reached the goal or not.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve decided to sit down by the way and have a lot of little happy moments, even if I never become a Great Author.</p>
<p class="text-left">You see what a little philosopher( 哲学家 ) I am becoming!</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">March 5th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">President( 校长 ) Cuyler made a speech this evening about how the modern generation is too disrespectful( 无礼的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I came away from chapel( 小教堂 ) very thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ought I to treat you with more dignity( 尊严 ) and seriousness, Daddy?</p>
<p class="text-left">Yes, I’m sure I ought. But I’m afraid I probably won’t.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours truly,</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">April 24th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy,</p>
<p class="text-left">Spring has come again!</p>
<p class="text-left">You should see how lovely the campus( 校园 ) is.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think you might come and look at it for yourself.</p>
<p class="text-left">Master( 老爷 ) Jervie dropped in again last Friday—but he chose a most inconvenient( 不方便的 ) time, for Sallie and Julia and I were just running to catch a train.</p>
<p class="text-left">And where do you think we were going?</p>
<p class="text-left">To Princeton, to go to a dance and a ball game!</p>
<p class="text-left">I didn’t ask you if I might go, because I had a feeling that your secretary would say no.</p>
<p class="text-left">But it was all very proper; we had leaves of absence from college, and Mrs. McBride chaperoned( 陪伴 ) us.</p>
<p class="text-left">We had a wonderful time—but I won’t go into details( 细节 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">They are too many and too hard to explain.</p>
<p class="text-left">Saturday</p>
<p class="text-left">Up before dawn( 拂晓 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">We walked two miles to the top of One Tree Hill to see the sunrise( 日出 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">We had to climb up the last slope( 斜坡 ) on our hands and knees!</p>
<p class="text-left">The sun almost beat us!</p>
<p class="text-left">And how hungry we were when we got back!</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy, I’m sorry, there are too many exclamation marks( 感叹号 ) on this page.</p>
<p class="text-left">I meant to have written a lot about the new leaves on the trees and the new running track( 跑道 ), and the awful lesson we have in biology( 生物 ) tomorrow,</p>
<p class="text-left">and the new canoes( 独木舟 ) on the lake, and my three new dresses—white and pink and blue, with a hat to match—but I am too sleepy.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am always making this an excuse, am I not?</p>
<p class="text-left">But a girls’ college is a busy place and we do get tired by the end of the day!</p>
<p class="text-left">Particularly when the day begins at dawn.</p>
<p class="text-left">Love,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">May 15th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">I really do love to write to you; it gives me such a respectable feeling of having some family.</p>
<p class="text-left">Would you like me to tell you something?</p>
<p class="text-left">You are not the only man to whom I write letters.</p>
<p class="text-left">There are two others! I have been receiving beautiful long letters this winter from Master Jervie (with the address typed, so Julia won’t know the writing).</p>
<p class="text-left">And every week or so a letter in very bad handwriting arrives from Princeton.</p>
<p class="text-left">I answer them all in a quick and business-like way.</p>
<p class="text-left">So you see, I am not so different from other girls. I get letters, too.</p>
<p class="text-left">There goes the bell for dinner. I’ll post this as I pass the box.</p>
<p class="text-left">Love,</p>
<p class="text-left">J.</p>
<p class="text-left">June 4th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy,</p>
<p class="text-left">Very busy time—summer vacation starts in ten days, examinations tomorrow.</p>
<p class="text-left">Lots of studying, lots of packing( 打包 ), and the outdoor world is so lovely that it hurts you to stay inside.</p>
<p class="text-left">But never mind, vacation’s coming.</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia is going abroad this summer—for the fourth time.</p>
<p class="text-left">No doubt about it, Daddy, life is not fair.</p>
<p class="text-left">Goodbye, Daddy.</p>
<p class="text-left">Have a nice summer and come back in the autumn rested and ready for another year of work. (That’s what you ought to be writing to me!)</p>
<p class="text-left">I haven’t any idea what you do in the summer, or what you do for fun.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can’t imagine what you do.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you play golf( 高尔夫 ), or ride horses or just sit in the sun and relax?</p>
<p class="text-left">Anyway, whatever it is, have a good time and don’t forget Judy.</p>
<p class="text-left">June 10th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy,</p>
<p class="text-left">This is the hardest letter I ever wrote.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I have decided what I must do, and there isn’t going to be any turning back.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is very sweet and generous( 慷慨的 ) of you to wish to send me to Europe this summer—for the moment I was carried away with the idea.</p>
<p class="text-left">But my more sensible( 明智的 ) second thoughts said no.</p>
<p class="text-left">It would be rather illogical( 不合理的 ) of me to refuse to take your money for college, and then use it instead just for amusement( 消遣 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">You mustn’t get me used to too many luxuries( 奢侈的事 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">One doesn’t miss what one has never had.</p>
<p class="text-left">But it’s very hard to go without things, after one has started to think they are his or hers by natural right.</p>
<p class="text-left">I believe that anyone can be happy no matter what their circumstances( 情况 ) are.</p>
<p class="text-left">But living with Sallie and Julia places a great strain( 压力 ) on that philosophy( 人生哲学 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">They have both had things from the time they were babies; they accept happiness as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="text-left">The World, they think, owes( 亏欠 ) them everything they want.</p>
<p class="text-left">Maybe the World does—in any case, it seems to pay up.</p>
<p class="text-left">But as for me, it owes me nothing, and told me so clearly in the beginning.</p>
<p class="text-left">I know these explanations seem complicated( 复杂的 ) and strange to you—but I hope you understand my meaning.</p>
<p class="text-left">Anyway, I have a very strong feeling that the only honest thing for me to do is to teach this summer and begin to support myself.</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">That was the beginning, and from day to day the duties given to her were added to.</p>
<p class="text-left">She taught the younger children French but this was the least of her labors.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was sent on errands( 差事 ) at any time and in all weathers.</p>
<p class="text-left">The cook and the housemaids took their tone( 语气 ) from Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">They rather enjoyed ordering about the “young one” who had been treated like she was so special for so long.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her own lessons became things of the past.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was taught nothing.</p>
<p class="text-left">Only after long and busy days was she allowed to go into the empty classroom, with a pile of old books, to study alone at night.</p>
<p class="text-left">One of the most curious things in her new existence was her changed position among the pupils.</p>
<p class="text-left">Instead of being a sort of royal presence among them, she no longer seemed to be one of their numbers at all.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was kept so constantly at work that she hardly ever had an opportunity of speaking to any of them.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin preferred that she should live a life apart from the other girls.</p>
<p class="text-left">The fact was that Miss Minchin’s pupils were used to being rich and comfortable.</p>
<p class="text-left">Meanwhile, Sara’s dress grew shorter and more worn out.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then the other girls found out that she was sent out to buy groceries( 杂货 ) and carry them through the streets.</p>
<p class="text-left">They felt therefore, that when they spoke to her, they should treat her like a servant.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara worked like a slave.</p>
<p class="text-left">She walked through the wet streets, carrying parcels( 包裹 ) and baskets.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her heart grew proud and angry, but she never told anyone what she felt.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Soldiers don’t complain( 抱怨 ),” she would say to herself, “I am not going to do it; I will pretend this is part of a war.”</p>
<p class="text-left">But there were hours when her child heart might almost have broken with loneliness but for two people.</p>
<p class="text-left">The first was Becky.</p>
<p class="text-left">They had little chance to speak to each other during the day.</p>
<p class="text-left">But before sunrise she used to come into Sara’s attic and help her dress.</p>
<p class="text-left">And when night came, Sara always heard the knock at her door which meant that Becky was ready to help her again if she was needed.</p>
<p class="text-left">The second comforter( 安慰者 ) was Ermengarde, but strange things happened before Ermengarde found her place.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Sara’s mind seemed to awaken again to the life about her, she realized that she had forgotten about Ermengarde.</p>
<p class="text-left">That was because she had been suddenly called home for a few weeks.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she came back she did not see Sara for a day or two.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Ermengarde met Sara for the first time, she saw her coming down a hallway( 走廊 ) with her arms full of clothing which were to be taken downstairs to be fixed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde could not think of anything to say.</p>
<p class="text-left">She knew what had happened, but, somehow, she had never imagined Sara could look like this—so poor and almost like a servant.</p>
<p class="text-left">It made her quite upset, and she could do nothing but break into a short laugh and say—“Oh, Sara, is that you?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” answered Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh,” she said nervously.</p>
<p class="text-left">“How—how are you?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t know,” Sara replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“How are you?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’m—I’m quite well,” said Ermengarde, shyly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she thought of something to say which seemed more considerate( 体贴的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are you—are you very unhappy?” she said in a rush.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then Sara was guilty( 内疚的 ) of an injustice.</p>
<p class="text-left">Just at that moment her torn( 破碎的 ) heart grew within her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She felt that if anyone was as stupid as that, one had better get away from her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What do you think?” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you think I am very happy?”</p>
<p class="text-left">And she marched past Ermengarde without another word.</p>
<p class="text-left">For several weeks, when they met by chance Sara looked the other way, and Ermengarde felt too ashamed to speak.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sometimes they nodded to each other in passing, but there were times when they did not even exchange a greeting.</p>
<p class="text-left">One night, when Sara went to her attic, she was surprised to see a light coming from under the attic door.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Nobody goes there but myself,” she thought quickly, “but someone has lighted a candle.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Someone had, indeed, lighted a candle, and was sitting upon the footstool, dressed in her nightgown( 睡衣 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It was Ermengarde.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Ermengarde!” cried Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You will get into trouble.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde stood up.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her eyes and nose were pink with crying.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I know I shall—if I’m found out,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But I don’t care—I don’t care a bit.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, Sara, please tell me.</p>
<p class="text-left">What is the matter?</p>
<p class="text-left">Why don’t you like me anymore?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Something in her voice made Sara suddenly remember her affection( 喜爱 ) for her old friend.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was so loving and simple—so like the old Ermengarde who had asked her to be “best friends.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I do like you,” Sara answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I thought—you see, everything is different now.</p>
<p class="text-left">I thought you—were different.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde opened her wet eyes wide.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why, it was you who were different!” she cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You didn’t want to talk to me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I didn’t know what to do.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was you who were different after I came back.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara thought a moment.</p>
<p class="text-left">She saw she had made a mistake.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am different,” she explained, “though not in the way you think.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin does not want me to talk to the girls.</p>
<p class="text-left">Most of them don’t want to talk to me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I thought—perhaps—you didn’t.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Sara,” Ermengarde cried out.</p>
<p class="text-left">And they rushed into each other’s arms.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then they sat down upon the floor together.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde looked round the attic with curiosity.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Sara,” she said, “do you think you can bear living here?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“If I pretend it’s quite different, I can,” she answered, “or if I pretend it is a place in a story.”</p></div>

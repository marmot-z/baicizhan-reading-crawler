                        <div><p class="text-left">I’ve sold my story, Daddy.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s going to be published( 被出版 ) in seven parts in a magazine, and then in a book!</p>
<p class="text-left">You might think I’d be wild with joy( 喜悦 ), but I’m not.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t care.</p>
<p class="text-left">Of course I’m glad to begin paying you—I owe( 欠 ) you over two thousand more.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s coming, one part at a time.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now please don’t make any difficulties about accepting it, because it makes me happy to return it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I owe you a great deal more than just the money.</p>
<p class="text-left">I will continue to pay the rest of it all my life in gratitude( 感激 ) and affection( 喜爱 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">And now, Daddy, about the other thing; please give me your advice, whether you think I’ll like it or not.</p>
<p class="text-left">You know that I’ve always had a very special feeling towards you.</p>
<p class="text-left">I feel that in a way you are my whole family.</p>
<p class="text-left">But you won’t mind, will you, if I tell you that I have a very much more special feeling for another man?</p>
<p class="text-left">You can probably guess without much trouble who he is.</p>
<p class="text-left">My letters have been very full of Master Jervie for a very long time.</p>
<p class="text-left">I wish I could make you understand what he is like and how good we are together.</p>
<p class="text-left">We think the same about most things—and when we don’t, I am afraid I sometimes change my ideas to match his!</p>
<p class="text-left">But he is almost always right.</p>
<p class="text-left">He ought to be, since he’s fourteen years older.</p>
<p class="text-left">In other ways, though, he’s just an overgrown boy( 大孩子 ) who needs looking after.</p>
<p class="text-left">He doesn’t have any sense about wearing rubber boots( 橡胶靴子 ) when it rains.</p>
<p class="text-left">He and I always think the same things are funny, and that’s important.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s terrible when two people’s senses of humor don’t match.</p>
<p class="text-left">I believe there’s no way to get over that!</p>
<p class="text-left">He is just himself, and I miss him.</p>
<p class="text-left">The whole world seems empty without him.</p>
<p class="text-left">I hate the moonlight because it’s beautiful and he isn’t here to see it with me.</p>
<p class="text-left">But maybe you’ve loved somebody, too, and you know?</p>
<p class="text-left">If you have, I don’t need to explain; if you haven’t, I can’t explain.</p>
<p class="text-left">Anyway, that’s the way I feel—and I’ve refused to marry him.</p>
<p class="text-left">I didn’t tell him why.</p>
<p class="text-left">I couldn’t think of anything to say.</p>
<p class="text-left">And now he has gone away, imagining that I want to marry Jimmie McBride.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t: Jimmie isn’t grown up enough.</p>
<p class="text-left">But Master Jervie and I had some misunderstandings, and we both hurt each other’s feelings( 感情 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The reason I sent him away was not because I didn’t care for him, but because I cared for him so much.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was afraid he would regret it in the future—and I couldn’t stand that!</p>
<p class="text-left">It didn’t seem right for a person of my background to marry into any such family as his.</p>
<p class="text-left">I never told him about the Home, and I hated to explain that I didn’t know who I was.</p>
<p class="text-left">I may be dreadful( 糟糕的 ), you know.</p>
<p class="text-left">And his family are proud—and I’m proud, too!</p>
<p class="text-left">Also, after having been educated as a writer, I owe it to you to at least try to be one.</p>
<p class="text-left">It wouldn’t be fair to accept your education and then go off and not use it.</p>
<p class="text-left">But now that I have sold a book and am going to be able to pay back the money, I feel that I have paid you back a little.</p>
<p class="text-left">Besides, I suppose I could keep on being a writer even if I did marry.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s possible to be both a writer and a wife.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve been thinking very hard about it.</p>
<p class="text-left">He has unusual ideas.</p>
<p class="text-left">Maybe he wouldn’t mind marrying a poor orphan( 孤儿 ) girl so much as some men might.</p>
<p class="text-left">Perhaps when two people are always happy together and lonely when they are apart, they ought not to let anything in the world stand between them.</p>
<p class="text-left">Of course I want to believe that!</p>
<p class="text-left">But I’d like to get your honest, objective opinion.</p>
<p class="text-left">You probably have a Family also, and will look at it from a worldly point of view and not just an emotional( 感情的 ), human point of view.</p>
<p class="text-left">So you see how brave I am to lay it before you.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suppose I go to him and explain that the trouble isn’t Jimmie, but is the John Grier Home—would that be a dreadful thing for me to do?</p>
<p class="text-left">It would take a great deal of courage.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’d almost rather be unhappy for the rest of my life.</p>
<p class="text-left">This happened nearly two months ago; I haven’t heard a word from him since he left.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was just getting sort of used to the feeling of a broken heart, when a letter came from Julia that stirred me all up( 惹我伤心 ) again.</p>
<p class="text-left">She said—very casually—that “Uncle Jervis” had been caught out all night in a storm, and had been ill ever since with pneumonia( 肺炎 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">And I never knew it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was feeling hurt because he had just disappeared without a word.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think he’s pretty unhappy, and I know I am!</p>
<p class="text-left">What seems to you the right thing for me to do?</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">October 6th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Yes, certainly I’ll come—at half past four next Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p class="text-left">Of course I can find the way.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve been in New York( 纽约，地名 ) three times and am not quite a baby.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can’t believe that I am really going to see you.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve been just thinking about you so long that it hardly seems as though you are a real flesh-and-blood person.</p>
<p class="text-left">You are awfully good, Daddy, to bother( 打扰 ) yourself with me, when you’re not strong.</p>
<p class="text-left">Take care and don’t catch cold.</p>
<p class="text-left">These fall rains are very damp( 潮湿的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Love,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">P. S. I’ve just had an awful thought.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you have a butler( 男管家 )?</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m afraid of butlers, and if one opens the door I shall faint( 晕过去 ) upon the step.</p>
<p class="text-left">What can I say to him?</p>
<p class="text-left">You didn’t tell me your name.</p>
<p class="text-left">Shall I ask for Mr. Smith?</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">Miss Rottenmeier, slowly getting up, approached the newcomers.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not seem pleased with Heidi, who wore her hat and scarf and was looking up at the lady’s headdress( 头饰 ) with innocent( 天真的 ) wonder.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What is your name?” the lady asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Heidi,” was the child’s clear answer.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What? Is that a Christian( 基督教的 ) name? What name was given to you in church?” asked the lady again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t remember that anymore,” the child replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What an answer! What does that mean?” said the housekeeper( 管家 ), shaking her head.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is the child ignorant( 无知的 ) or impolite( 不礼貌的 ), Miss Deta?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I shall speak for the child, if I may, madam( 夫人 ),” Deta said,</p>
<p class="text-left">after giving Heidi a little blow for her unacceptable answer.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The child has never been in such a fine house and does not know how to behave( 举止得体 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">She is called Adelheid after her mother, who was my sister.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh well, that is better. But Miss Deta, the child seems strange for her age.</p>
<p class="text-left">I thought I told you that Miss Clara’s companion( 同伴 ) would have to be twelve years old like her, to be able to share her studies.</p>
<p class="text-left">How old is Adelheid?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am sorry, but I am afraid she is somewhat younger than I thought.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think she is about ten years old.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandfather said that I was eight years old,” said Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">Deta gave her another blow, but as the child had no idea why, she did not get embarrassed( 尴尬的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“What, only eight years old!” Miss Rottenmeier shouted angrily.</p>
<p class="text-left">“How can we get along? What have you learned? What books have you studied?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“None,” said Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But how did you learn to read?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I can’t read and Peter can’t do it either,” Heidi replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What! You cannot read?” cried the lady in her surprise.</p>
<p class="text-left">“How is it possible? What else have you studied?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Nothing,” replied Heidi, truthfully.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Miss Deta, how could you bring this child?” asked the housekeeper.</p>
<p class="text-left">Deta, however, was not easily afraid, and said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am sorry, but I thought this child would suit( 符合 ) your needs.</p>
<p class="text-left">She is small, but older children are often spoilt( 宠坏的 ) and not like her.</p>
<p class="text-left">I must go now, for my mistress( 女主人 ) is waiting.</p>
<p class="text-left">As soon as I can, I’ll come to see how the child is getting along.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Soon she was outside and with a few quick steps she hurried downstairs( 下楼 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Rottenmeier followed her and tried to call her back, for she wanted to ask Deta a number of questions.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was still standing in the same spot( 地方 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara had watched the scene, and called to the child to come to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi approached the wheelchair.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you want to be called Heidi or Adelheid?” asked Clara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“My name is Heidi and nothing else,” was the child’s answer.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’ll call you Heidi then, for I like it very much,” said Clara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have never heard the name before. What curly( 卷的 ) hair you have! Was it always like that?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I think so.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Did you like to come to Frankfurt( 地名，法兰克福 )?” asked Clara again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, no, but then I am going home again tomorrow, and shall bring grandmother some soft white rolls( 面包卷 ),” Heidi explained.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What a curious( 稀奇古怪的 ) child you are,” said Clara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You have come to Frankfurt to stay with me, don’t you know that?</p>
<p class="text-left">We shall have our lessons together, and I think it will be great fun when you learn to read.</p>
<p class="text-left">Generally the morning seems to have no end, for the tutor( 家庭教师 ) Mr. Candidate comes at ten and stays till two.</p>
<p class="text-left">That is a long time, and he has to yawn( 打呵欠 ) himself, as he gets so tired.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When Miss Rottenmeier found that she was unable to call Deta back, she came back to the children.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was very annoyed( 生气的 ), for she felt responsible for( 对...负责 ) Heidi’s coming, and she did not know how to cancel this unfortunate( 不幸的 ) step.</p>
<p class="text-left">She soon got up again to go to the dining room, shouting at the butler( 男管家 ) Sebastian and giving orders to the maid( 女仆 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">When Sebastian went up to Clara’s chair, he saw Heidi watching him closely.</p>
<p class="text-left">At last she said, “You look like Peter.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Rottenmeier was shocked( 震惊的 ) when Heidi said this, and sent them all into the dining room.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Heidi saw a roll on her plate( 盘子 ), she turned to Sebastian, and pointing at it, asked,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Can I have this?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi already trusted the butler, especially because she had discovered he looked like Peter.</p>
<p class="text-left">The butler nodded, and when he saw Heidi put the bread in her pocket, he could hardly keep from laughing.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Rottenmeier explained to Heidi with many signs how to help herself at table.</p>
<p class="text-left">She also told her never to speak to Sebastian unless it was important.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the question came up of how to call Clara, the older girl said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Of course you shall call me Clara.”</p>
<p class="text-left">A great many rules followed about behavior( 行为 ) at all times.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was told about the shutting( 关 ) of doors and about going to bed, and a hundred other things.</p>
<p class="text-left">Poor Heidi’s eyes were closing, for she had risen at five that morning, and resting against her chair she fell asleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Miss Rottenmeier had finished instructions, she said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I hope you will remember everything, Adelheid. Did you understand me?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Heidi went to sleep a long time ago,” said Clara, highly amused( 愉快的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is terrible that I have to bear with this child,” shouted Miss Rottenmeier, ringing the bell with all her might( 力气 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">When the two servants arrived, they were hardly able to wake Heidi enough to show her to her bedroom.</p></div>

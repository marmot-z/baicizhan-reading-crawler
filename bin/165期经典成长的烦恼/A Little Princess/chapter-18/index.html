                        <div><p class="text-left">A week or so later, Ermengarde had found it safe to steal up to the attic, and Sara told her about her new friend.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde was interested, as she always was.</p>
<p class="text-left">“When you talk about things,” she said, “they seem as if they grew real.</p>
<p class="text-left">You talk about Melchisedec as if he was a person.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“He is a person,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He gets hungry and frightened, just as we do.</p>
<p class="text-left">How do we know he doesn’t think things, just as we do?</p>
<p class="text-left">His eyes look as if he was a person.</p>
<p class="text-left">That was why I gave him a name.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Besides,” she said, “he is a Bastille rat sent to be my friend.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can always get a bit of bread the cook has thrown away, and it is quite enough to support him.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you always pretend it is the Bastille?” asked Ermengarde.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Nearly always,” answered Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">Just at that moment Ermengarde almost jumped off the bed, she was so surprised by a sound she heard.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was like two knocks on the wall.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What is that?” she asked nervously.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara got up from the floor and answered quite dramatically( 戏剧性地 ):</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is the prisoner in the next cell.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Becky!” cried Ermengarde, excitedly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Listen; the two knocks meant, ‘Prisoner, are you there?’ ”</p>
<p class="text-left">She knocked three times on the wall herself, as if in answer.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That means, ‘Yes, I am here, and all is well.’ ”</p>
<p class="text-left">Four knocks came from Becky’s side of the wall.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That means,” explained Sara, “ ‘Then, fellow-sufferer( 难友 ), we will sleep in peace. Good night.’ ”</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde beamed( 绽开笑容 ) with delight.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Sara!” she whispered joyfully.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is like a story!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is a story,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“everything’s a story.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And she sat down again and talked until Ermengarde forgot that she was a sort of escaped prisoner herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had to be reminded by Sara that she could not remain in the Bastille all night.</p>
<p class="text-left">She must steal quietly downstairs again and return to her bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">But it was a dangerous thing for Ermengarde to make trips to the attic.</p>
<p class="text-left">She could never be quite sure when Sara would be there.</p>
<p class="text-left">She could also never be certain that Miss Amelia would not make a tour through the bedrooms after the pupils were supposed to be asleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">So her visits were seldom, and Sara lived a lonely life.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the evening, Sara passed houses whose windows were lighted up.</p>
<p class="text-left">She used to look into the warm rooms and imagine things about the people she saw sitting before the fires or about the tables.</p>
<p class="text-left">There were several families in the square in which Miss Minchin lived, with which she had become quite familiar in a way of her own.</p>
<p class="text-left">The one she liked best she called the Large Family.</p>
<p class="text-left">She called it the Large Family not because the members of it were big—for, indeed, most of them were little—but because there were so many of them.</p>
<p class="text-left">There were eight children in the Large Family, and a kind, warm mother, and a kind, warm father, and many servants.</p>
<p class="text-left">The eight children were always either being taken out to walk by nurses, or they were going to drive with their mamma.</p>
<p class="text-left">They were flying to the door in the evening to meet their papa and kiss him and dance around him.</p>
<p class="text-left">They were crowding about the nursery windows and looking out and pushing each other and laughing.</p>
<p class="text-left">In fact, they were always doing something enjoyable and suited to a large family.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara was quite fond of them, and had given them names out of books—quite romantic names.</p>
<p class="text-left">She called them the Montmorencys when she did not call them the Large Family.</p>
<p class="text-left">She gave special names to the children, like Rosalind Gladys, Guy Clarence, and Veronica Eustacia.</p>
<p class="text-left">One evening a very funny thing happened—though, perhaps, in one sense it was not a funny thing at all.</p>
<p class="text-left">Several of the Montmorencys were evidently going to a children’s party.</p>
<p class="text-left">Just as Sara was about to pass the door, they were crossing the pavement( 人行道 ) to get into the carriage which was waiting for them.</p>
<p class="text-left">Veronica Eustacia and Rosalind Gladys, in white lace dresses, had just got in. Guy Clarence, who was five years old, was following them.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was such a pretty fellow and had such pink cheeks and blue eyes that Sara paused and looked at him.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was Christmas time.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Large Family had been hearing many stories about children who were poor and cold and hungry.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the stories, kind people—sometimes little boys and girls—saw the poor children and gave them money or rich gifts.</p>
<p class="text-left">Guy Clarence burned with a desire to find such a poor child and give her a certain sixpence he had.</p>
<p class="text-left">As he crossed the pavement to the carriage, he saw Sara standing in her worn out( 破旧不堪的 ) dress and hat, looking at him hungrily.</p>
<p class="text-left">He thought that her eyes looked hungry because she had perhaps had nothing to eat for a long time.</p>
<p class="text-left">He did not know that they looked so because she was hungry for the warm, happy life his home held.</p>
<p class="text-left">He put his hand in his pocket and found his sixpence and walked up to her.</p></div>

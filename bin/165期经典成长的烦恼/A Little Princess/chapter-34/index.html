                        <div><p class="text-left">Sara took a step toward her and stood still.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was thinking of the day when she had been told that she belonged to nobody, and was in danger of being turned into the street.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was thinking of the cold, hungry hours she had spent alone with Emily and Melchisedec in the attic.</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked Miss Minchin firmly in the face.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You know why I will not go home with you, Miss Minchin,” she said; “you know quite well.”</p>
<p class="text-left">A hot redness showed itself on Miss Minchin’s angry face.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You do not have an easy charge,” she said to the Indian gentleman, as she turned to leave the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The child is neither truthful nor thankful. I suppose”—to Sara—“that you feel now that you are a princess again.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I—tried not to be anything else,” she answered in a low voice—“even when I was coldest and hungriest—I always tried to be a princess.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now it will not be necessary to try,” said Miss Minchin, bitterly, as Ram Dass showed her out of the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">She returned home and, going to her sitting room, sent at once for Miss Amelia.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she had told her sister what had happened, the silly woman cried many tears.</p>
<p class="text-left">One of her unfortunate remarks almost caused her sister to bite her head entirely off, but it resulted in an unusual manner.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’m not as clever as you, sister,” Amelia said, “and I am always afraid to say things to you for fear of making you angry.</p>
<p class="text-left">Perhaps if I were not so weak, it would be better for the school and for both of us.</p>
<p class="text-left">I must say I’ve often thought that the child was a good child.</p>
<p class="text-left">She would have paid you for any kindness you had shown her.</p>
<p class="text-left">But you didn’t show her any.</p>
<p class="text-left">The fact was, she was too clever for you, and you always disliked her for that reason.</p>
<p class="text-left">She used to see through us both—”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Amelia!” said her angry elder sister in surprise.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She did! She did!” Amelia cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She saw through us both.</p>
<p class="text-left">She saw that you were a hard-hearted woman.</p>
<p class="text-left">And I was a weak fool, while she behaved like a little princess even when she was a beggar.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And she began to laugh and cry both at once, and rock herself backward( 向后 ) and forward.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And now you’ve lost her,” she cried wildly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Some other school will get her and her money.</p>
<p class="text-left">And if she were like any other child she’d tell how she’s been treated, and all our pupils would be taken away.</p>
<p class="text-left">We should be ruined.</p>
<p class="text-left">And it serves us right, but it serves you right more than it does me, for you are a hard woman, Maria Minchin, you’re a hard, selfish woman!”</p>
<p class="text-left">She was in danger of making so much noise with her crying that her sister had to give her salts to quiet her.</p>
<p class="text-left">And from that time forward, the elder Miss Minchin actually began to respect her sister and almost fear her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Amelia was evidently not quite so foolish as she looked, and could speak truths people did not want to hear.</p>
<p class="text-left">That evening, the pupils were together in the classroom, as was their custom before bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde came in with a letter in her hand and an expression of delighted excitement.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What is the matter?” cried two or three voices at once.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is it anything to do with the row that has been going on?” said Lavinia, eagerly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There has been such a row in Miss Minchin’s room, Miss Amelia has had something like a fit and has had to go to bed.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde answered them slowly as if she were half awake.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have just had this letter from Sara,” she said, holding it out to let them see what a long letter it was.</p>
<p class="text-left">“From Sara!” Every voice joined in that cry.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Where is she?” almost screamed Jessie.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Next door,” said Ermengarde, “with the Indian gentleman.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Where? Where? Has she been sent away?</p>
<p class="text-left">Does Miss Minchin know? Was the row about that? Why did she write?</p>
<p class="text-left">Tell us! Tell us!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“There were diamond mines,” she said; “there were!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Open mouths and open eyes confronted( 正视 ) her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Until almost midnight the entire school crowded round Ermengarde in the classroom.</p>
<p class="text-left">They heard Ermengarde read and re-read the letter with a story which was quite as wonderful as any Sara herself had ever invented.</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky, who had heard it also, managed to go upstairs earlier than usual.</p>
<p class="text-left">She wanted to get away from people and go and look at the little magic room once more.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not know what would happen to it.</p>
<p class="text-left">It would likely be taken away, and the attic would be empty again.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was glad for Sara, but she went up the last flight of stairs with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">There would be no fire tonight; no supper, and no princess sitting telling stories.</p>
<p class="text-left">She tried not to sob as she pushed the attic door open, and then she broke into a low cry.</p>
<p class="text-left">The fire was shining, the supper was waiting, and Ram Dass was standing smiling into her surprised face.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Miss sahib remembered,” he said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She wished you to know the good fortune which has happened to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Behold( 看看 ) a letter on the tray.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not wish that you should go to sleep unhappy.</p>
<p class="text-left">The sahib asks you to come to him tomorrow.</p>
<p class="text-left">You are to be the maid of miss sahib.</p>
<p class="text-left">Tonight I take these things back over the roof.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And having said this with a smiling face, he made a little bow and went through the skylight again.</p>
<p class="text-left">There never were such friends as Sara and Mr. Carrisford became.</p>
<p class="text-left">Somehow, they seemed to suit each other in a wonderful way.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Indian gentleman had never had a companion he liked quite as much as he liked Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">In a month’s time he was, as Mr. Carmichael had said he would be, a new man.</p></div>

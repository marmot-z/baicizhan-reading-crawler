                        <div><p class="text-left">I have a beautiful game I like to play.</p>
<p class="text-left">I invented it a long time ago, when I first learned to read.</p>
<p class="text-left">I put myself to sleep every night by pretending( 假装 ) I’m a person in the book I’m reading at the moment.</p>
<p class="text-left">At present I’m Ophelia—and such a sensible( 明智的 ) Ophelia!</p>
<p class="text-left">I keep Hamlet happy all the time, and make him wear a scarf when he has a cold.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve entirely cured( 治愈 ) him of being sad.</p>
<p class="text-left">The King and Queen are both dead—an accident( 事故 ) at sea; no funeral( 葬礼 ) necessary—so Hamlet and I are peacefully ruling in Denmark.</p>
<p class="text-left">We have the kingdom working beautifully.</p>
<p class="text-left">He takes care of the governing, and I look after the charities( 慈善机构 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I have just created some first-class Homes for Orphans( 孤儿 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">If you or any of the other Trustees( 董事会成员 ) would like to visit them, I shall be pleased to show you through.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think you might find a great many helpful suggestions.</p>
<p class="text-left">I remain, sir,</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours most graciously( 亲切地 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">OPHELIA,</p>
<p class="text-left">Queen of Denmark.</p>
<p class="text-left">March 24th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t believe I can be going to Heaven( 天堂 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I am getting such a lot of good things here; it wouldn’t be fair to get them after I die as well.</p>
<p class="text-left">Listen to what has happened.</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha Abbott has won the short story competition (a twenty-five dollar prize) that the Monthly holds every year.</p>
<p class="text-left">And she’s a second-year!</p>
<p class="text-left">The competitors are mostly fourth-years.</p>
<p class="text-left">When I saw my name posted, I couldn’t quite believe it was true.</p>
<p class="text-left">Maybe I am going to be an author after all.</p>
<p class="text-left">I wish Mrs. Lippett hadn’t given me such a silly name.</p>
<p class="text-left">And Julia and Sallie and I are going to New York( 纽约 ) next Friday to do some spring shopping.</p>
<p class="text-left">We will stay the night, and go to the theatre the next day with “Master( 大人 ) Jervie.”</p>
<p class="text-left">He invited us.</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia is going to stay at home with her family, but Sallie and I are going to stop at the Martha Washington Hotel.</p>
<p class="text-left">Did you ever hear of anything so exciting?</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve never been in a hotel in my life, nor in a theater.</p>
<p class="text-left">Once the local church had a festival and invited the orphans, but that wasn’t a real play and it doesn’t count.</p>
<p class="text-left">And what do you think we’re going to see?</p>
<p class="text-left">Hamlet. Think of that!</p>
<p class="text-left">We studied it for four weeks in Shakespeare class and I know it by heart.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am so excited about it all that I can hardly sleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">April 7th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Isn’t New York big? Worcester is nothing compared to it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you mean to tell me that you really live there?</p>
<p class="text-left">I was only there for two days, and I don’t believe that I shall recover( 恢复正常 ) for months.</p>
<p class="text-left">Aren’t the streets fascinating( 迷人的 )?</p>
<p class="text-left">And the people?</p>
<p class="text-left">And the shops?</p>
<p class="text-left">I never saw such lovely things as there are in the windows.</p>
<p class="text-left">It makes you want to think about nothing but what clothes to wear.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie and Julia and I went shopping together on Saturday morning.</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia went into the fanciest( 豪华的 ) place I ever saw, white and gold walls, blue carpets( 地毯 ), blue silk curtains( 窗帘 ), and chairs painted like gold.</p>
<p class="text-left">A perfectly beautiful lady, wearing a long black silk dress, came to meet us with a welcoming smile.</p>
<p class="text-left">I thought we were paying a social call, and started to shake hands.</p>
<p class="text-left">But it seemed we were only buying hats—at least Julia was.</p>
<p class="text-left">She sat down in front of a mirror( 镜子 ) and tried on twelve, each lovelier than the last.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she bought the two loveliest of all.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can’t imagine any joy( 快乐 ) in life greater than buying any hat you choose without worrying about the price!</p>
<p class="text-left">There’s no doubt about it, Daddy;</p>
<p class="text-left">New York would soon destroy( 摧毁 ) my modest( 谦虚的 ) character, which the John Grier Home so patiently built up.</p>
<p class="text-left">And after we’d finished our shopping, we met Master Jervie at Sherry’s restaurant.</p>
<p class="text-left">I suppose you’ve been to Sherry’s?</p>
<p class="text-left">Compare that with the dining room of the John Grier Home, and you can imagine the way I felt!</p>
<p class="text-left">I ate my fish with the wrong fork, but the waiter very kindly gave me another so that nobody noticed.</p>
<p class="text-left">And after lunch we went to the theater.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was wonderful, unbelievable—I dream about it every night.</p>
<p class="text-left">Isn’t Shakespeare wonderful?</p>
<p class="text-left">Hamlet is so much better on the stage than when we talk about it in class.</p>
<p class="text-left">I appreciated( 感谢 ) it before, but now, dear me!</p>
<p class="text-left">I think, if you don’t mind, that I’d rather be an actress than a writer.</p>
<p class="text-left">Wouldn’t you like me to leave college and learn how to act?</p>
<p class="text-left">And then I’ll send you tickets for all the plays I’m in, and smile at you in the audience( 观众 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Only wear a red rose, please, so I know I’m smiling at the right man.</p>
<p class="text-left">It would be very embarrassing( 尴尬的 ) to smile at the wrong one.</p>
<p class="text-left">We came back Saturday night and had our dinner in the train, at little tables with pink lamps( 灯 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I never heard of meals being served in trains before, and by mistake I said so.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Where on earth were you brought up?” said Julia to me.</p>
<p class="text-left">“In a village,” I replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But didn’t you ever travel?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Not till I came to college, and then it was only a hundred and sixty miles, so we didn’t eat,” I replied.</p></div>

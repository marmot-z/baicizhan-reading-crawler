                        <div><p class="text-left">The weather was warm and sunny that month.</p>
<p class="text-left">Every morning the doctor came up to the Alp, spending his day very often with the old man.</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle would show his guest all the herbs( 药草 ) that grew on hidden places.</p>
<p class="text-left">He could tell many strange things of the beasts( 野兽 ) that lived in holes in rock or earth, or in the high tops of trees.</p>
<p class="text-left">But he spent most of his days with Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then the two would sit together on the child’s favorite spot( 地方 ), and Peter sat behind them by himself.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi would sing him songs, and entertain( 使快乐 ) him with all the things she knew.</p>
<p class="text-left">At last the beautiful month of September was over.</p>
<p class="text-left">One morning the doctor came up with a sadder face than usual.</p>
<p class="text-left">The time had come for him to go back to Frankfurt, and the uncle’s sadness at that news was great.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi herself could hardly realize that her loving friend, whom she had been seeing every day, was really leaving.</p>
<p class="text-left">The doctor himself did not want to go, for the Alp had become a home to him.</p>
<p class="text-left">But it was necessary for him to go.</p>
<p class="text-left">Shaking hands with the grandfather, he said good bye.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi went along with him a little way.</p>
<p class="text-left">Hand in hand they wandered down( 往下走 ), till the doctor stood still.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then touching Heidi’s curly( 卷卷的 ) hair, he said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now I must go, Heidi! I wish I could take you along with me to Frankfurt.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Shaking hands, they parted.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi stayed on the same spot, waving( 摇 ) her hand and looking after her friend till he seemed no bigger than a little dot( 点 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he looked back a last time at Heidi and the sunny Alp, saying to himself,</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is beautiful up there.</p>
<p class="text-left">Body and soul( 灵魂 ) get strengthened in that place and life seems worth living again.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The snow lay deep around the Alm-hut.</p>
<p class="text-left">It came all the way up to the windows, and the door had entirely disappeared. Around Peter’s hut it was the same.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the boy went out to dig a way through the snow, he had to creep( 爬 ) through the window;</p>
<p class="text-left">then he would sink( 沉 ) deep into the soft snow and kick with arms and legs to get free.</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle had moved down to the village with Heidi and his goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">Near the church lay an old ruin( 废墟 ) that once had been a spacious building.</p>
<p class="text-left">Years ago, when the uncle had come to the village with Tobias, he had lived there.</p>
<p class="text-left">On approaching the house from the back, there was an open room, where nearly all the walls lay in ruins.</p>
<p class="text-left">On one side, the remains of a church room could be seen, now covered with plants.</p>
<p class="text-left">A large hall came next, with a beautiful stone floor and grass growing in the cracks( 缝隙 ) in the floor.</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle had made a wooden partition( 隔板 ) here for the goats, and covered the floor with straw( 稻草 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Several passages led finally to a room with a heavy iron door.</p>
<p class="text-left">This room was still in good condition.</p>
<p class="text-left">In one corner was a huge stove( 炉子 ), which nearly reached up to the ceiling( 天花板 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi discovered a bed placed between the wall and the stove.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh grandfather, I have found my bedroom,” shouted the little girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, how fine it is!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was delighted( 高兴的 ) with her new home.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Peter arrived the next day, she did not rest till he had seen every corner of the curious( 稀奇古怪的 ) place.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi slept very well in her corner, but it took her many days to get used to it.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she woke up in the morning and could not hear the fir( 冷杉 ) trees roar( 咆哮 ), she would wonder where she was.</p>
<p class="text-left">But as soon as she heard her grandfather’s voice outside, she remembered everything and would jump merrily( 欢乐地 ) out of bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">After four days had gone by, Heidi said to her grandfather,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I must go to grandmother now, for she has been alone for so many days.”</p>
<p class="text-left">But the grandfather shook his head and said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“You can’t go yet, child.</p>
<p class="text-left">The snow is very deep up there and is still falling.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter can hardly get through.</p>
<p class="text-left">A little girl like you would be snowed up and lost in no time.</p>
<p class="text-left">Wait a while till it freezes( 结冰 ) and then you can walk on top of it!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was very sorry, but she was so busy now that the days flew by.</p>
<p class="text-left">Every morning and afternoon she went to school, eagerly( 急切地 ) learning whatever she was taught.</p>
<p class="text-left">She hardly ever saw Peter there, for he did not come very often.</p>
<p class="text-left">But when Heidi came home towards evening, Peter generally paid her a visit.</p>
<p class="text-left">After a few days the sun came out for a short time at noon, and the next morning the whole Alp shone like crystal( 水晶 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter came down to visit Heidi. Afterwards( 之后 ) Heidi climbed up with him, because she wanted to see grandmother.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they went into the room, Peter’s mother was alone at the table mending( 修补 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmother was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="text-left">Brigida told Heidi that the grandmother needed to stay in bed on those cold days, as she did not feel very strong.</p>
<p class="text-left">That was something new for Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">Quickly running to the old woman’s room, she found her lying in a narrow( 狭小的 ) bed, covered in her gray scarf and thin blanket( 毯子 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Thank Heaven( 上帝 )!”</p>
<p class="text-left">the grandmother shouted out when she heard Heidi’s step.</p>
<p class="text-left">All autumn and winter long she was secretly afraid that Heidi would be taken away.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter had told her so much about the strange gentleman that had appeared,</p>
<p class="text-left">and she was afraid Heidi may be leaving again soon.</p></div>

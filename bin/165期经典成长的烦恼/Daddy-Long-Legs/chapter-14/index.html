<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">We beat the first-years at basketball yesterday.</p>
<p class="text-left">Of course we’re pleased—but oh, if we could only beat the third-years!</p>
<p class="text-left">I’d be willing to be black and blue all over and stay in bed for a week.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie has invited me to spend the Christmas vacation with her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She lives in Worcester, Massachusetts.</p>
<p class="text-left">Wasn’t it nice of her?</p>
<p class="text-left">I shall love to go.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve never been in a private family in my life, except at Lock Willow( 柳树 ), and the Semples were grown-up and old and don’t count.</p>
<p class="text-left">But the McBrides have a house full of children (anyway two or three) and a mother and father and grandmother, and a cat.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s a perfectly complete family!</p>
<p class="text-left">Packing( 打包 ) your bags and going away is more fun than staying behind.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am terribly excited at the idea.</p>
<p class="text-left">Seventh period—I must run to rehearsal( 排练 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m to be in the Thanksgiving( 感恩节 ) play.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m going to be a prince( 王子 ) in a tower.</p>
<p class="text-left">Doesn’t that sound like fun?</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours,</p>
<p class="text-left">J. A.</p>
<p class="text-left">Saturday</p>
<p class="text-left">Do you want to know what I look like?</p>
<p class="text-left">Here’s a photograph of all three of us that Leonora Fenton took.</p>
<p class="text-left">The blonde( 头发金黄的 ) one who is laughing is Sallie.</p>
<p class="text-left">The tall one with her nose in the air is Julia.</p>
<p class="text-left">And the little one with the hair blowing across her face is Judy—she is really more beautiful than that, but the sun was in her eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">“STONE GATE,”</p>
<p class="text-left">WORCESTER, MASSACHUSSETS,</p>
<p class="text-left">December 31st</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">I meant to write to you before and thank you for the money you sent me for Christmas.</p>
<p class="text-left">But life in the McBride house is very busy, and I don’t seem able to find two minutes to spend at a desk.</p>
<p class="text-left">I bought a new dress—one that I didn’t need, but just wanted.</p>
<p class="text-left">My Christmas present this year is from Daddy-Long-Legs; my family just sent love.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve been having the most beautiful vacation visiting Sallie.</p>
<p class="text-left">She lives in a big old house with the windows and doors painted white.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is set back from the street—exactly the kind of house that I used to look at so curiously( 好奇地 ) when I was in the John Grier Home.</p>
<p class="text-left">I never expected to see with my own eyes—but here I am! Everything is so comfortable and restful.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is the most perfect house for children to be brought up in, with out-of-the-way corners for hide and seek( 捉迷藏 ), and open fire places for popcorn( 爆米花 ), and an attic( 阁楼 ) to play in on rainy days.</p>
<p class="text-left">And there are slippery banisters( 滑溜溜的扶手 ) to slide( 滑 ) down, and a great big sunny kitchen.</p>
<p class="text-left">And there’s a nice, fat, happy cook who has lived in the family for thirteen years, and always saves a piece of dough( 生面团 ) for the children to bake( 烘焙 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Just the sight of such a house makes you want to be a child all over again.</p>
<p class="text-left">I never dreamed families could be so nice.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie has a father and mother and grandmother, and the sweetest three-year-old baby sister with curly( 卷的 ) hair.</p>
<p class="text-left">She has a younger brother who always forgets to wipe( 擦拭 ) his feet, and a big, good-looking brother named Jimmie, who is a student at Princeton.</p>
<p class="text-left">We have such fun times at the table—everybody laughs and jokes and talks at once, and we don’t have to say grace( 祷告 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s a relief( 解脱 ) not having to thank Somebody for every mouthful you eat.</p>
<p class="text-left">(Perhaps I’m ungrateful( 不感激的 ), but you’d be, too, if you were forced to offer thanks as often as I have been.)</p>
<p class="text-left">We have done such a lot of things—I don’t know where to begin telling you about them.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. McBride owns a factory, and on Christmas Eve he had a tree for the workers’ children.</p>
<p class="text-left">Jimmie McBride was dressed as Santa Claus, and Sallie and I helped him pass out the presents.</p>
<p class="text-left">Daddy, it was such a strange feeling!</p>
<p class="text-left">I felt as charitable( 慷慨的 ) as a Trustee( 董事 ) of the John Grier home.</p>
<p class="text-left">I kissed one sweet little boy—but I don’t think I patted( 轻拍 ) any of them on the head!</p>
<p class="text-left">And two days after Christmas, they gave a dance at their own house for ME.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was the first real dance I ever went to—college doesn’t count, because we dance with girls.</p>
<p class="text-left">I had a new white evening dress (your Christmas present—many thanks) and long white gloves and white dancing shoes.</p>
<p class="text-left">If only Mrs. Lippett could have seen me dancing with Jimmie McBride!</p>
<p class="text-left">Tell her about it, please, the next time you visit the J. G. H.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S. Would you be terribly disappointed( 失望的 ), Daddy, if I didn’t turn out to be a Great Author after all, but just a Plain( 平凡的 ) Girl?</p>
<p class="text-left">6.30, Saturday</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy,</p>
<p class="text-left">We started to walk to town today, but it rained so hard!</p>
<p class="text-left">I like winter to be winter, with snow instead of rain.</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia’s desirable uncle called again this afternoon—and brought a five-pound box of chocolates.</p>
<p class="text-left">There are advantages, you see, to sharing rooms with Julia.</p>
<p class="text-left">Our girlish talk seemed to amuse( 逗...笑 ) him, and he waited for a later train in order to take tea in the study.</p>
<p class="text-left">We had a lot of trouble getting permission( 许可 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s hard enough having fathers and grandfathers in our rooms, but uncles are a step worse.</p>
<p class="text-left">As for brothers and cousins, they are next to impossible.</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia had to swear( 发誓 ) that he was her uncle, and even then, I doubt if we could have had our tea if the Dean( 系主任 ) had seen how youngish and good-looking Uncle Jervis is.</p>
<p class="text-left">Anyway, we had it, with brown bread and cheese( 奶酪 ) sandwiches.</p>
<p class="text-left">He helped make them, and then ate four.</p>
<p class="text-left">I told him that I had spent last summer at Lock Willow( 柳树 ).</p></div>

                        <br> 
                        <div><p class="text-left">The school was in a row of connected houses, and Sara liked to think of the things being done on the other side of the wall of the rooms she lived in.</p>
<p class="text-left">She amused herself by imagining the things hidden by the wall which divided the school from the Indian gentleman’s house.</p>
<p class="text-left">She knew that the classroom was next to the Indian gentleman’s study.</p>
<p class="text-left">She hoped that the wall was thick so that the noise made sometimes after lesson hours would not trouble him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am growing quite fond of him,” she said to Ermengarde;</p>
<p class="text-left">“I should not like him to be troubled.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have adopted him for a friend.</p>
<p class="text-left">You can do that with people you never speak to at all.</p>
<p class="text-left">You can just watch them, and think about them and be sorry for them, until they seem almost like relations.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m quite anxious sometimes when I see the doctor come to visit twice a day.”</p>
<p class="text-left">There was much discussion of his case in the kitchen, where the servants knew everything through some mysterious means.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was not an Indian gentleman really, but an Englishman who had lived in India.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had met with great misfortunes which had for a time so endangered( 危及 ) his whole fortune that he had thought himself ruined forever.</p>
<p class="text-left">The shock had been so great that he had almost died of brain fever.</p>
<p class="text-left">Since then, he had been sick, though his fortunes had changed and all his possessions had been given back to him.</p>
<p class="text-left">His trouble had been connected with mines.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And mines with diamonds in them!” said the cook.</p>
<p class="text-left">“No savings of mine will ever go into mines—particular diamond ones”—with a side look at Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“We all know something of them.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“He felt as my papa felt,” Sara thought.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He was ill as my papa was, but he did not die.”</p>
<p class="text-left">So her heart was more drawn to him than before.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she was sent out at night, she used sometimes to feel quite glad.</p>
<p class="text-left">There was always a chance that the curtains of the house next door might not yet be closed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she could look into the warm room and see her adopted friend.</p>
<p class="text-left">The gentleman she called Mr. Montmorency went to see him often, and Mrs. Montmorency and all the little Montmorencys went, too, though less often.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had, in fact, a very caring place in his heart for all children, and particularly for little girls. Janet and Nora were as fond of him as he was of them.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He is a poor thing,” said Janet, “and he says we cheer him up. We try to cheer him up very quietly.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The Indian gentleman’s real name was Mr. Carrisford, and Janet told Mr. Carrisford about their meeting with the little-girl-who-was-not-a-beggar.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was very much interested, and all the more so when he heard from Ram Dass of the adventure of the monkey on the roof.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ram Dass made for him a very clear picture of the attic and its loneliness.</p>
<p class="text-left">He mentioned the empty floor and broken wall, the unused, empty fireplace, and the hard, small bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Carmichael,” he said to the father of the Large Family, after he had heard Ram Dass’s description.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I wonder how many of the attics in this square are like that one.</p>
<p class="text-left">How many poor little servant girls sleep on such beds, while I cannot sleep on my down pillows, troubled by wealth that is, most of it—not mine.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“My dear fellow,” Mr. Carmichael answered cheerily, “the sooner you stop worrying, the better it will be for you.</p>
<p class="text-left">Even if you had all the wealth of all the Indies, you still could not set right all the discomforts in the world.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you began to make all the attics in this square more livable, there would still remain all the attics in all the other squares and streets to put in order. And there you are!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Carrisford sat and bit his nails as he looked into the shining bed of coals in the fireplace.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you suppose,” he said slowly, after a pause—</p>
<p class="text-left">“do you think it is possible that the other child—the child I never stop thinking of—could be—could possibly be lowered to any such condition as the poor little girl next door?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Carmichael looked at him uneasily.</p>
<p class="text-left">He knew that the worst thing the man could do for himself, for his reason and his health, was to begin to think of this particular subject.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If the child at Madame Pascal’s school in Paris was the one you are searching for,” he answered kindly, “she is with people who can afford to take care of her.</p>
<p class="text-left">They adopted( 收养 ) her because she had been the favorite companion of their little daughter who died.</p>
<p class="text-left">They had no other children, and Madame Pascal said that they were very well-to-do Russians.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“And the terrible woman actually did not know where they had taken her!” said Mr. Carrisford angrily.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Carmichael shrugged( 耸肩 ) his shoulders.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The adopted parents seem to have disappeared and left no trace( 踪迹 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But you say ‘if’ the child was the one I am searching for.</p>
<p class="text-left">You say ‘if.’ We are not sure. There was a difference in the name.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Madame Pascal pronounced it as if it were Carew instead of Crewe—but that might be merely a matter of accent.</p>
<p class="text-left">The situations were strangely similar.</p>
<p class="text-left">An English officer in India had placed his motherless little girl at the school.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had died suddenly after losing his money.”</p></div>

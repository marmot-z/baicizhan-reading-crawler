                        <div><p class="text-left">Every evening now on his return home, Peter would read one song to his grandmother, but never more.</p>
<p class="text-left">Brigida praised him, but the old woman once replied,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am glad he has learnt something.</p>
<p class="text-left">But still I am longing for the spring to come.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then Heidi can visit me, for when she reads, the songs sound so different.</p>
<p class="text-left">I cannot always follow Peter, and the songs don’t excite me the way they do when Heidi says them!”</p>
<p class="text-left">And no wonder!</p>
<p class="text-left">For Peter would often leave out long and difficult words—what did three or four words matter!</p>
<p class="text-left">So it happened sometimes that there were hardly any words left in the songs that Peter read.</p>
<p class="text-left">May had come.</p>
<p class="text-left">Warm sunshine was bathing( 照耀 ) the whole Alp in glorious( 灿烂的 ) light.</p>
<p class="text-left">Having melted( 融化 ) the last snow, it had brought the first spring flowers to the surface.</p>
<p class="text-left">A merry( 令人愉快的 ) spring wind was blowing, drying up the wet places in the shadow( 阴影 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">High above in the blue sky the eagle( 鹰 ) flew peacefully.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi and her grandfather were back on the Alp.</p>
<p class="text-left">The child was so happy to be home again that she jumped about among the objects she loved.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter arrived, whistling( 吹口哨 ) and calling.</p>
<p class="text-left">As usual, Heidi was soon surrounded( 被包围 ) by the goats( 山羊 ), who also seemed happy to be back on the Alp.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter, angrily pushing the goats aside, marched up to Heidi, putting a letter into her hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi immediately recognized( 认出 ) Clara’s handwriting.</p>
<p class="text-left">Running to her grandfather, she shouted out,</p>
<p class="text-left">“A letter has come from Clara! Wouldn’t you like me to read it to you, grandfather?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter had followed Heidi, and she immediately read aloud to her two listeners, as follows:—</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Heidi,</p>
<p class="text-left">We are all packed up( 整理好行装 ) and shall travel in two or three days.</p>
<p class="text-left">Papa is leaving, too, but not with us, for he has to go to Paris( 巴黎，地名 ) first.</p>
<p class="text-left">The dear doctor came nearly every day this winter.</p>
<p class="text-left">He told us all about you and the grandfather and the mountains and the flowers he saw.</p>
<p class="text-left">He is much better since his visit, and seems younger and happier.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, how I look forward to it all!</p>
<p class="text-left">The doctor’s advice is that I shall go to Ragatz first for about six weeks.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then I can go to live in the village, and from there I shall come to see you every fine day.</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandmama, who is coming with me, is looking forward to the trip too.</p>
<p class="text-left">Goodbye, dear Heidi, with much love from grandmama,</p>
<p class="text-left">I am your true friend,</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Peter heard this, he swung( 摆动 ) his rod( 杆 ) from right to left.</p>
<p class="text-left">Angrily driving the goats before him, he ran down the hill.</p>
<p class="text-left">The month of June was nearing its end and flowers were growing everywhere, filling the air with perfume( 香味 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">One morning Heidi came running out of the hut, where she had already completed her duties.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly she screamed( 喊叫 ) so loud that the grandfather hurriedly came out to see what had happened.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandfather! Come here! Look, look!”</p>
<p class="text-left">A strange group of people were climbing up the Alp.</p>
<p class="text-left">First marched two men, carrying a chair with a young girl in it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then came a stately( 神态庄重的 ) lady on horseback( 马背 ), looking eagerly right and left.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then an empty wheelchair, carried by a young fellow, who was followed by a porter( 门房 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“They are coming! They are coming!” cried Heidi in her joy( 欢乐 ), and soon the party had arrived at the top.</p>
<p class="text-left">Great was the happiness of the children at seeing each other again.</p>
<p class="text-left">When grandmama had come down from her horse, she said hello to Heidi first, and then turned to the uncle, who had approached the group.</p>
<p class="text-left">The two met like old friends.</p>
<p class="text-left">They had heard so much about each other.</p>
<p class="text-left">After the first words were exchanged( 互相交谈 ), the grandmother said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“My dear uncle, what a wonderful house you have.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, how well my Heidi is looking, just like a little rose!”</p>
<p class="text-left">she continued, drawing the child close to her side and patting( 轻拍 ) her cheeks( 脸颊 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“What glory everywhere! Clara, what do you say to it all?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara, looking about her excitedly, cried:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, how wonderful, how glorious( 华丽的 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">I have never dreamt it could be as beautiful as that.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh grandmama, I wish I could stay here!”</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle had busied himself in the meantime( 同时 ) with getting Clara’s wheelchair for her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then, going up to the girl, he gently lifted her into her seat.</p>
<p class="text-left">Putting some covers over her knees, he tucked( 把...卷入 ) her feet in warmly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“My dear uncle,” said the grandmama, surprised,</p>
<p class="text-left">“please tell me where you learned that!</p>
<p class="text-left">I shall send all the nurses I know here immediately.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle smiled faintly( 微微地 ), while he replied,</p>
<p class="text-left">“It comes more from care than study.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara had looked at the cloudless sky above and the rocky mountain tops for a long time.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she said longingly to Heidi,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I wish I could walk round the hut to the fir( 冷杉 ) trees.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I only could see all the things you told me so much about!”</p></div>

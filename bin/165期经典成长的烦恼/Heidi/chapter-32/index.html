                        <div><p class="text-left">A day before her visit, the grandmama had sent a letter to announce( 通知 ) her coming.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter brought it up with him next morning.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather was already before the hut with the children and his merry( 欢乐的 ) goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">His face looked proud, as he looked at the red faces of the girls and the shining hair of his two goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter, approaching, neared the uncle slowly.</p>
<p class="text-left">As soon as he had delivered( 投递 ) the letter, he sprang back shyly, looking about him as if he was afraid.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then with a jump he started off.</p>
<p class="text-left">All the way Peter was taken by fear.</p>
<p class="text-left">He could not help thinking of the policeman who was coming from Frankfurt( 法兰克福，地名 ) to bring him to prison( 监狱 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a busy morning for Heidi, who put the hut in order for the expected visitor.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather also returned from a walk, on which he had gathered( 聚集 ) a lot of glorious( 美丽的 ) deep blue flowers.</p>
<p class="text-left">The children, who were sitting near the house, shouted for joy( 欢乐 ) when they saw the flowers.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi, getting up from time to time to look down the path( 小路 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">suddenly discovered grandmama, sitting on a white horse and accompanied( 陪伴 ) by two men.</p>
<p class="text-left">The party came nearer and nearer, and soon reached the top.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What do I see? Clara, what is this? Why are you not sitting in your chair? How is this possible?”</p>
<p class="text-left">cried the grandmama in alarm( 慌张 ), while she quickly got off her horse.</p>
<p class="text-left">Before she had quite reached the children, she threw her arms up in great excitement:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Clara, is that really you? You have a red, round cheek( 脸颊 ), my child! I hardly know you anymore!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandmama was going to rush at her grandchild, when Heidi was getting up, and Clara, taking her arm, got up too.</p>
<p class="text-left">They quietly took a little walk.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmama was rooted to the spot( 呆住不动 ) from fear.</p>
<p class="text-left">What was this? Straightly and firmly, Clara walked beside her friend.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they came back, their red faces beamed( 眉开眼笑 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Rushing toward the children, the grandmama hugged( 拥抱 ) them over and over again.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then the grandmama looked at the uncle, who sat on the bench( 长凳 ) smiling.</p>
<p class="text-left">Taking Clara’s arm in hers, she walked over to him, continually expressing her delight( 高兴 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">When she reached the old man, she took both his hands in hers and said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“My dear, dear uncle! How much we have to thank you for! This is your work, your care and nursing—”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then Clara called,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, and also Schwänli’s good, delicious milk.</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandmama, you ought to see how much goat milk I can drink now; oh, it is so good!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Indeed, I can see that from your cheeks,” said the grandmama, smiling.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I hardly recognize( 认出 ) you anymore. Now I must telegraph( 给...发电报 ) your father to come.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I shan’t tell him anything about you, for it will be the greatest joy of all his life.</p>
<p class="text-left">My dear uncle, how are we going to manage it?</p>
<p class="text-left">Have you sent the two men who accompanied me away?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have, but I can easily send the goatherd( 牧羊人 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">So they decided that Peter should take the message.</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle immediately whistled( 吹口哨 ) so loud that it could be heard everywhere.</p>
<p class="text-left">Soon Peter arrived, white with fear, for he thought the grandfather had found out what he had done.</p>
<p class="text-left">But he only received a paper that was to be carried to the post office of the village.</p>
<p class="text-left">Relieved( 放松的 ) for the moment, Peter set out.</p>
<p class="text-left">Meanwhile( 同时 ) Mr. Sesemann, having finished his business in Paris( 巴黎，地名 ), was also preparing a surprise.</p>
<p class="text-left">Without writing to his mother, he traveled to Ragatz on a sunny summer morning.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had arrived on this very day, some hours after his mother’s departure( 离开 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">And now, taking a carriage, he drove to Mayenfeld.</p>
<p class="text-left">The long way up to the Alp from there seemed very tiring and far to the traveler.</p>
<p class="text-left">When would he reach the grandfather’s hut?</p>
<p class="text-left">There were many little roads branching( 分叉 ) off in several directions,</p>
<p class="text-left">and sometimes Mr. Sesemann doubted if he had taken the right path.</p>
<p class="text-left">Standing still and cooling his face, he saw a boy running down the hill at topmost speed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann called to him, but with no success, for the boy kept at a shy distance.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now, my boy, can’t you tell me if I am on the right path to the hut</p>
<p class="text-left">where Heidi lives and the people from Frankfurt are staying?”</p>
<p class="text-left">A low sound of terror( 惊恐 ) was the only reply.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter shot off and rushed head over heels( 用尽全力地 ) down the mountain side.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What a funny, shy mountaineer!” Mr. Sesemann remarked( 说 ) to himself.</p>
<p class="text-left">After watching the boy going down a little while, he soon went on his way.</p>
<p class="text-left">Despite the greatest effort, Peter could not stop himself, and kept rolling down( 滚下 ) the mountain.</p>
<p class="text-left">But his fright( 害怕 ) was still more terrible than the pain.</p>
<p class="text-left">This stranger was the policeman—that was a certain fact!</p>
<p class="text-left">At last Peter was caught in a bush( 灌木丛 ), and was able to keep himself from falling any farther.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter got back to his feet.</p>
<p class="text-left">He longed to go home to bed and hide, for he only felt safe there.</p>
<p class="text-left">But he had to go up to the goats, and the uncle had clearly told him to come back as quickly as he could.</p>
<p class="text-left">Groaning( 呻吟 ), he walked up to the Alp.</p>
<p class="text-left">How could he run now, with his fear and his poor, painful body?</p></div>

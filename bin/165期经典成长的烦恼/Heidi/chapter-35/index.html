                        <div><p class="text-left">Heidi, in her happiness, could hardly wait to bring the old woman the good news.</p>
<p class="text-left">Soon it was decided that everybody should visit the grandmother, who had been left alone so long.</p>
<p class="text-left">Before starting, however, Mr. Sesemann told them his plans.</p>
<p class="text-left">He wanted to travel through Switzerland( 瑞士，地名 ) with his mother and Clara.</p>
<p class="text-left">He would spend the night in the village, so as to fetch( 带 ) Clara from the Alp next morning for the journey.</p>
<p class="text-left">From there they would go first to Ragatz and then further.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara’s feelings( 感受 ) were divided, for she was sorry to leave the Alp, but the plan of the trip delighted( 使高兴 ) her.</p>
<p class="text-left">When everything was settled( 被安排好 ), they all went down.</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle carried Clara, who could not have risked the lengthy walk.</p>
<p class="text-left">All the way down Heidi told the old lady of her friends in the hut,</p>
<p class="text-left">about the cold they had to bear in winter, and the little food they had.</p>
<p class="text-left">Brigida was just hanging up Peter’s shirt to dry, when the whole company arrived.</p>
<p class="text-left">Rushing into the house, she called to her mother:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now they are all going away. Uncle is going, too, carrying the lame( 跛的 ) child.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, must it really be?” sighed( 叹息 ) the grandmother.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Have you seen whether they took Heidi away?</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, if she could only give me her hand once more!</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, I long to hear her voice once more!”</p>
<p class="text-left">The same moment the door was thrown open and Heidi held her tight( 紧紧地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandmother, just think.</p>
<p class="text-left">My bed with the three pillows( 枕头 ) and the thick cover is coming from Frankfurt.</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandmama has said that it will be here in two days.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, what a good lady she must be!</p>
<p class="text-left">I know I ought to be glad she is taking you with her, but I don’t think I shall live long when you are gone.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But nobody has said so,” the grandmama said kindly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Pressing the old woman’s hand, she continued,</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is out of the question. Heidi will stay with you and make you happy.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, what wonderful things God is doing for me!” said the grandmother, deeply touched.</p>
<p class="text-left">“My dear grandmother,” said Mrs. Sesemann,</p>
<p class="text-left">“now we must say goodbye; next year we shall come to see you just as soon as we come up the Alp.</p>
<p class="text-left">We shall never forget you!” With that, Mrs. Sesemann shook her hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was some time before Mrs. Sesemann was allowed to leave,</p>
<p class="text-left">because the grandmother thanked her over and over again.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann and his mother went on downward( 向下 ), while Clara was carried up to spend her last night in the hut.</p>
<p class="text-left">Next morning, Clara cried hot tears( 眼泪 ) at parting from the place she loved, where such gladness had been hers.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi comforted her with plans for the coming summer, which was to be even happier than this one.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann then arrived, and a few last parting words were said.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara, half crying, suddenly said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Please give my love to Peter and the goats, Heidi!</p>
<p class="text-left">Please greet( 向...问候 ) Schwänli especially from me, for she has helped a great deal in making me well.”</p>
<p class="text-left">It was time to go now, and Clara was able to ride proudly beside her father.</p>
<p class="text-left">Standing on the edge of the mountain, Heidi waved( 挥动 ) her hand, with her eyes following Clara till she had disappeared.</p>
<p class="text-left">The bed has arrived.</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandmother now sleeps so well every night that before long she will be stronger than ever.</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandmama has not forgotten the cold winter on the Alp and has sent a great many warm covers and scarfs( 围巾 ) to the goatherd’s hut.</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandmother can wrap( 裹 ) herself now and will not have to sit shaking in a corner.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the village a large building is in progress.</p>
<p class="text-left">The doctor has arrived and is living at present in his old quarters.</p>
<p class="text-left">He has taken the uncle’s advice and has bought the old ruins( 废墟 ) that sheltered( 庇护 ) Heidi and her grandfather before.</p>
<p class="text-left">He is rebuilding the part with the fine apartment( 公寓 ) for himself.</p>
<p class="text-left">The other side is being prepared for Heidi and her grandfather.</p>
<p class="text-left">The doctor knows that his friend is an independent man and likes to have his own space.</p>
<p class="text-left">Bärli and Schwänli, of course, are not forgotten;</p>
<p class="text-left">they will spend the winter in a good new shed( 棚 ) that is being built for them.</p>
<p class="text-left">The doctor and the Alm-Uncle become better friends every day.</p>
<p class="text-left">They have agreed to share together the pleasure and responsibility( 责任 ) that Heidi brings them.</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle is so thankful that he cannot express it in words, when the doctor tells him that he will provide for the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now her grandfather’s heart is free of care.</p>
<p class="text-left">Even if he is called away, another father will take care of Heidi and love her instead.</p>
<p class="text-left">At the moment when our story closes, Heidi and Peter are sitting with grandmother.</p>
<p class="text-left">The little girl has a lot of interesting things to share, and the others are trying so hard not to miss anything.</p>
<p class="text-left">All summer long they have hardly met, and very many wonderful things have happened.</p>
<p class="text-left">They are all glad at being together again.</p></div>

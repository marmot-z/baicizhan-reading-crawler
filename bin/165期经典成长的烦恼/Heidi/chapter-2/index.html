                        <div><p class="text-left">“All right, but keep your word!” said Deta,</p>
<p class="text-left">looking around to see that the child was not so close to them as to hear what might be said;</p>
<p class="text-left">but the little girl was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="text-left">While the two young women had talked at such a rate, they had not noticed her absence;</p>
<p class="text-left">quite some time must have passed since the little girl had given up following her companions( 同伴 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Deta, standing still, looked about her everywhere.</p>
<p class="text-left">No one was on the path( 小路 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“There she is!” shouted Barbara,</p>
<p class="text-left">pointing to a spot( 地点 ) a good distance from the path.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is climbing up with the goatherd( 牧羊人 ) Peter and his goats( 山羊 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">“It will be very easy for Peter to watch her,” remarked( 说 ) Deta;</p>
<p class="text-left">“she is bright for her five years and keeps her eyes wide open.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have often noticed that and I am glad for her, for it will be useful with the uncle.</p>
<p class="text-left">He has nothing left in the whole wide world, but his cottage( 乡间小屋 ) and two goats!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Did he once have more?” asked Barbara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I should say so.</p>
<p class="text-left">His parents used to have a large farm in Domleschg, which he received when they died.</p>
<p class="text-left">But he lost everything by gambling( 赌博 ) and drinking, then he disappeared.</p>
<p class="text-left">After many years he came back with a half-grown son, Tobias.</p>
<p class="text-left">The boy became a worker who made the wooden support of buildings.</p>
<p class="text-left">My mother’s grandmother was a cousin of his, so we called him uncle.</p>
<p class="text-left">Because we are related on my father’s side to nearly all the people in the village, they too all called him uncle.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was named ‘Alm-Uncle’ when he moved up to the Alm.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But what happened to Tobias?” asked Barbara eagerly( 急切地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Just wait. How can I tell you everything at once?” shouted Deta.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Tobias married my sister Adelheid.</p>
<p class="text-left">They lived a happy life, but their joy( 欢乐 ) was short.</p>
<p class="text-left">Two years later, when Tobias was helping to build a house, a beam( 横梁 ) fell on him and killed him.</p>
<p class="text-left">Adelheid was thrown into a violent( 急剧的 ) fever with sadness and fear, and never recovered( 康复 ) from it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Only a few weeks after Tobias’s death, they buried( 埋葬 ) poor Adelheid.</p>
<p class="text-left">“People said that heaven( 天堂 ) had punished the uncle for what he had done wrong.</p>
<p class="text-left">After the death of his son, he never spoke to a living soul( 活人 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly he moved up to the Alm, to live there as an enemy of God and the people.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“My mother and I took Adelheid’s little baby, Heidi, to live with us.</p>
<p class="text-left">When I went to Ragatz I took her with me;</p>
<p class="text-left">but in the spring, the family that I had worked for last year decided to take me to their townhouse( 城镇住房 ) in Frankfurt.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am very glad to get such a good position.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“And now you want to hand over the child to this terrible old man.</p>
<p class="text-left">I really wonder how you can do it, Deta!” said Barbara with blame( 责备 ) in her voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have really done enough for the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">I do not know where else to take her, as she is too young to come with me to Frankfurt.</p>
<p class="text-left">By the way, Barbara, where are you going?</p>
<p class="text-left">We are halfway up the Alm already.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Almost there!” said Barbara.</p>
<p class="text-left">Deta shook hands with her companion and stood still.</p>
<p class="text-left">Barbara approached a tiny, dark brown mountain hut( 小屋 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">which lay in a hollow( 凹陷处 ) a few steps away from the path.</p>
<p class="text-left">Situated halfway up the Alm, the cottage was luckily protected from the mighty winds.</p>
<p class="text-left">Still, the doors and windows made noise,</p>
<p class="text-left">and the old hut shook when the south wind swept( 掠过 ) the mountain side.</p>
<p class="text-left">Here lived Peter the goatherd, who was eleven years old.</p>
<p class="text-left">Every day, he fetched( 取 ) the goats from the village and drove them up the mountain to the short and green grass.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter raced down in the evening with the light-footed little goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">When he whistled( 吹口哨 ) loudly through his fingers, every owner would come and get his or her goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">At home lived his mother and an old blind grandmother, but he only spent time in the hut for breakfast and dinner.</p>
<p class="text-left">His father, who had met with an accident( 意外 ) some years ago, also had been called Peter the goatherd.</p>
<p class="text-left">His mother, Brigida, was called “Goatherd Peter’s wife”</p>
<p class="text-left">and his blind grandmother was called just “grandmother” by young and old from many miles about.</p>
<p class="text-left">Deta waited to see if the two children were coming up behind with the goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">As she could not find them anywhere, she climbed up a little higher to get a better view.</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked from side to side, with marks of great impatience( 不耐烦 ) on her face.</p>
<p class="text-left">During this time, the children were climbing up the mountain slowly in a zigzag( 之字形的 ) way.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter always knew where to find all sorts of good places for his goats where they could eat the grass.</p>
<p class="text-left">The poor little girl had followed the boy with the greatest effort and she was breathing( 呼吸 ) heavily in her heavy clothes.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly sitting down on the ground, the child quickly took off her shoes and stockings( 袜子 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Getting up, she took off the heavy scarf and the two little dresses.</p>
<p class="text-left">She took everything off and stood up in only a light skirt.</p>
<p class="text-left">To save the trouble of carrying them, her aunt had dressed her in her Sunday clothes over her everyday clothes.</p></div>

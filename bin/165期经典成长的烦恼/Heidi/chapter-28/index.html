                        <div><p class="text-left">Heidi pushed with all her might, and look!</p>
<p class="text-left">The wheelchair rolled( 滚 ) easily over the dry grass.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they passed the empty goat shed( 棚 ), Clara said pitifully,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh grandmama, if I could only wait up here for Schwänli and Bärli!</p>
<p class="text-left">I am afraid I shan’t see Peter and his goats, if we have to go away so soon again.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Dear child, enjoy this moment,” said the grandmama, who had followed.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, what wonderful flowers!” said Clara again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There are whole bushes of( 一丛丛 ) excellent, red blossoms( 花 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, if I could only pick some of those beautiful flowers!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi, immediately gathering( 采集 ) many of them, put them on Clara’s lap( 大腿 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Clara, this is really nothing in comparison with the many flowers in the pasture( 牧场 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">You must come up once and see them.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, grandmama, do you think I can ever go up there?” Clara asked with a wild longing( 渴望 ) in her eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If I could only walk with you, Heidi, and climb round everywhere!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’ll push you!” Heidi said for comfort.</p>
<p class="text-left">To show how easy it was, she pushed the chair.</p>
<p class="text-left">It moved so fast that it almost fell down the mountain, but the grandfather was there to stop it at the last moment.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was time for lunch now.</p>
<p class="text-left">The table was set up outside, and soon everybody sat down.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmama was overcome( 被深深折服 ) by the view and the delicious wind that fanned her cheek( 脸颊 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">She remarked( 说 ):</p>
<p class="text-left">“What a wonderful place this is!</p>
<p class="text-left">I have never seen anything like it! But what do I see?” she continued.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I think you are eating your second piece of cheese( 奶酪 ), Clara?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh grandmama, it tastes better than all the things we get in Ragatz,”</p>
<p class="text-left">replied the child, eagerly eating the tasty dish.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That’s right, eat as much as you can!” said the old man satisfied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s the mountain air that makes up for the faults( 瑕疵 ) of the cooking.”</p>
<p class="text-left">During the meal the uncle and the grandmama had soon got into a lively conversation.</p>
<p class="text-left">They seemed to agree on many things, and understood each other like old friends.</p>
<p class="text-left">A little later the grandmama looked over to the west.</p>
<p class="text-left">“We must soon start, Clara, for the sun is already low; our guides will be here shortly.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara’s face had become sad.</p>
<p class="text-left">She asked whether she could still see the hut, and the grandmama agreed.</p>
<p class="text-left">The wheelchair was too big for the door, so the uncle quietly lifted Clara in his strong arms and carried her in.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the uncle showed her Heidi’s bedroom, she said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“What a lovely place to sleep! Oh, Heidi, you can look right up to the sky from your bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">You can hear the fir( 冷杉 ) trees roar( 咆哮 ) here, can’t you?</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, I never saw a more delightful( 使人愉快的 ) bedroom!”</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle, looking at the old lady, said now,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have an idea. I believe it would give Clara new strength to stay up here with us a little while.</p>
<p class="text-left">You have brought so many covers that we can easily make a soft bed for Clara here.</p>
<p class="text-left">My dear lady, you can easily leave the care to me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ll undertake( 承担 ) it gladly.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The children screamed( 大叫 ) for joy( 欢乐 ), and grandmama’s face was beaming( 眉开眼笑的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“What a fine man you are!” she burst out( 说出口 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“I was just thinking myself that a stay here would strengthen the child, but then I thought of the care and trouble for you.</p>
<p class="text-left">And now you have offered to do it, as if it was nothing at all.</p>
<p class="text-left">How can I thank you enough, uncle?”</p>
<p class="text-left">After shaking hands many times, the two prepared Clara’s bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thanks to the old lady’s preparations, the bed was soon so soft that the hay( 干草 ) could not be felt at all.</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle had carried his new patient back to her wheelchair, and there they found her sitting, with Heidi beside her.</p>
<p class="text-left">They were eagerly talking of their plans for the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they were told that Clara might stay for a month or so, their faces beamed more than ever.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the grandmama got ready to leave, she said that she would go back to Ragatz, but she promised to come back from time to time.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter came racing down to the hut with all his goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">Seeing Heidi, they ran up to her quickly, and so Clara met Schwänli and Bärli and all the others.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter, however, kept away, only sending angry looks at the two girls.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they said good night, he only ran away, beating the air with his stick.</p>
<p class="text-left">The end of the joyous day had come.</p>
<p class="text-left">The two children were both lying in their beds.</p>
<p class="text-left">As soon as Heidi lay down, she fell asleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">But Clara could not sleep quite yet, it was too wonderful to see the stars from her bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">In truth, she had never seen them before.</p>
<p class="text-left">In Frankfurt all the blinds( 窗帘 ) were always down long before the stars came out, and at night she had never been outside the house.</p>
<p class="text-left">She could hardly keep her eyes shut.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had to open them again and again to watch the stars, till her eyes closed at last and she saw two big twinkling( 闪闪发光的 ) stars in her dream.</p></div>

<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">This is going to be very short because my shoulder hurts at the sight of a pen.</p>
<p class="text-left">Taking lecture( 讲座 ) notes all day, and working on my novel( 小说 ) all evening, make too much writing.</p>
<p class="text-left">We will have our graduation ceremony( 毕业典礼 ) in three weeks from next Wednesday.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think you might come and meet me—I shall hate you if you don’t!</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia’s inviting Master( 老爷 ) Jervie, since he’s a relative, and Sallie’s inviting Jimmie McBride, for the same reason, but who is there for me to invite?</p>
<p class="text-left">Just you and Lippett, and I don’t want her. Please come.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours, with love and aching( 疼痛的 ) fingers,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">LOCK WILLOW( 柳树 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">June 19th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m educated! My diploma( 毕业证书 ) is in the bottom drawer( 抽屉 ) with my two best dresses.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thank you for your roses.</p>
<p class="text-left">They were lovely.</p>
<p class="text-left">Master Jervie and Jimmie both gave me roses, too, but I left theirs in water at home and carried yours at the graduation ceremony.</p>
<p class="text-left">Here I am at Lock Willow for the summer—perhaps forever( 永远的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s peaceful, and it’s easy to write here.</p>
<p class="text-left">What more does an author want?</p>
<p class="text-left">I am mad about my book.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think of it every waking moment, and dream of it at night.</p>
<p class="text-left">All I want is peace and quiet and lots of time to work (and good meals, of course).</p>
<p class="text-left">I’d be expecting to have you come and visit—only I know now that that is hopeless.</p>
<p class="text-left">When you wouldn’t come to my graduation, I tore( 扯出 ) you from my heart and buried( 埋葬 ) you forever.</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy Abbott, Bachelor of Arts( 文科学士 )</p>
<p class="text-left">July 24th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Isn’t it fun to work—or don’t you ever do it?</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s especially fun when that work is the thing you’d rather do than anything else in the world.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve been writing as fast as my pen would go every day this summer.</p>
<p class="text-left">My only problem with life is that the days aren’t long enough to write all the beautiful and valuable and fun thoughts I’m thinking.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve finished the second draft( 草稿 ) of my book, and am going to begin the third tomorrow morning at half past seven.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s the sweetest book you ever saw—it is, truly.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think of nothing else.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can hardly wait in the morning to dress and eat before beginning; then I write and write and write till suddenly I’m exhausted( 筋疲力尽的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Then I go out with Colin (the new sheep dog) and run through the fields and get a fresh supply of ideas for the next day.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s the most beautiful book you ever saw—Oh, sorry—I said that before.</p>
<p class="text-left">You don’t think that I am too proud of my work, do you, Daddy dear?</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m not, really, only just now I’m in the enthusiastic( 狂热的 ) stage.</p>
<p class="text-left">Maybe later on I’ll get cold and critical( 批判的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">No, I’m sure I won’t!</p>
<p class="text-left">This time I’ve written a real book.</p>
<p class="text-left">Just wait till you see it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I still love you, Daddy dear, and I’m very happy.</p>
<p class="text-left">With beautiful scenery all about, and lots to eat, and a comfortable bed and plenty of paper and lots of ink( 墨水 )—what more does one want in the world?</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours as always,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">PS. The postman arrives with some more news.</p>
<p class="text-left">We are to expect Master Jervie next Friday.</p>
<p class="text-left">He will be staying for a week.</p>
<p class="text-left">That’s something to look forward to—only I am afraid my poor book will suffer( 受苦 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Master Jervie is very demanding.</p>
<p class="text-left">August 27th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Where are you, I wonder?</p>
<p class="text-left">I never know what part of the world you are in, but I hope you’re not in New York( 纽约，地名 ) during this awful weather.</p>
<p class="text-left">I hope you’re on a mountaintop( 山顶 ) (but not in Switzerland( 瑞士，地名 ); somewhere nearer) looking at the snow and thinking about me.</p>
<p class="text-left">Please be thinking about me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m quite lonely and I want to be thought about.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, Daddy, I wish I knew you!</p>
<p class="text-left">Then when we were unhappy we could cheer each other up.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t think I can stand much more of Lock Willow.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m thinking of moving.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sallie is going to do charity( 慈善 ) work with the poor in Boston next winter.</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t you think it would be nice for me to go with her, and then we could get an apartment( 公寓 ) together?</p>
<p class="text-left">I would write while she did her charity work, and we could be together in the evenings.</p>
<p class="text-left">Evenings are very long when there’s no one but the Semples and Carrie and Amasai to talk to.</p>
<p class="text-left">I know already that you won’t like my idea.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can read your secretary’s letter now:</p>
<p class="text-left">“To Miss Jerusha Abbott.</p>
<p class="text-left">“DEAR MADAM( 女士 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">“Mr. Smith prefers( 更愿意 ) that you remain at Lock Willow.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yours truly,</p>
<p class="text-left">“ELMER H. GRIGGS.”</p>
<p class="text-left">I hate your secretary!</p>
<p class="text-left">But truly, Daddy, I think I shall have to go to Boston.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can’t stay here.</p>
<p class="text-left">If something doesn’t happen soon, I shall kill myself.</p>
<p class="text-left">And it’s too hot here. It hasn’t rained for weeks and weeks.</p>
<p class="text-left">This letter sounds as if I have gone crazy, but I haven’t. I just want some family.</p>
<p class="text-left">Goodbye, my dearest Daddy.</p>
<p class="text-left">I wish I knew you.</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">LOCK WILLOW,</p>
<p class="text-left">September 19th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy,</p>
<p class="text-left">Something has happened and I need advice.</p>
<p class="text-left">I need it from you, and from nobody else in the world.</p>
<p class="text-left">Wouldn’t it be possible for me to see you?</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s so much easier to talk than to write; and I’m afraid your secretary might open the letter.</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S. I’m very unhappy.</p>
<p class="text-left">LOCK WILLOW,</p>
<p class="text-left">October 3rd</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Your note in your own (shaky) handwriting came this morning.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am so sorry that you have been ill.</p>
<p class="text-left">I wouldn’t have bothered( 打扰 ) you with my problems if I had known.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yes, I will tell you the trouble, but it’s sort of complicated( 复杂的 ) to write, and very private.</p>
<p class="text-left">Please don’t keep this letter, but burn it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Before I begin—here’s a check for one thousand dollars.</p>
<p class="text-left">It seems funny, doesn’t it, for me to be sending a check to you?</p>
<p class="text-left">Where do you think I got it?</p></div>

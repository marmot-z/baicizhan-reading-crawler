                        <div><p class="text-left">Monsieur Dufarge arrived very soon after.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was a very nice, middle-aged Frenchman.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is this a new pupil for me, madame( 【法】夫人 )?” he said to Miss Minchin, when he saw Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Her papa—Captain Crewe—wants her to begin the language.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I am afraid she does not seem to wish to learn,” said Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am sorry of that, mademoiselle( 【法】小姐 ),” he said kindly to Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Perhaps, when we begin to study together, I may show you that it is a wonderful language.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Little Sara rose in her seat.</p>
<p class="text-left">She knew that he would understand as soon as she spoke.</p>
<p class="text-left">She began to explain in fluent( 流利的 ) French.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had not learned French exactly—not out of books—but her papa had always spoken it to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had read it and written it as she had read and written English.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her dear mamma, who had died when she was born, had been French.</p>
<p class="text-left">She would be glad to learn anything monsieur( 【法】先生 ) would teach her, but what she had tried to explain was that she already knew the words in this book.</p>
<p class="text-left">She held out the little book of phrases.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she began to speak, Miss Minchin started quite suddenly and sat staring at her over her eyeglasses until she had finished.</p>
<p class="text-left">Monsieur Dufarge began to smile.</p>
<p class="text-left">To hear this pretty childish voice speaking his own language made him feel almost as if he were in his own country.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she had finished, he spoke to Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Ah, madame,” he said, “there is not much I can teach her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She has not learned French; she is French. Her accent is perfect.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You ought to have told me,” cried out Miss Minchin, much ashamed, turning to Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I—I tried,” said Sara. “I—I suppose I did not begin right.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin knew she had tried, and that it had not been her fault that she was not allowed to explain. And when she saw that the pupils had been listening and that Lavinia and Jessie were laughing she felt very angry.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Silence, young ladies!” she said strictly. “Silence at once!”</p>
<p class="text-left">And from that minute she began to feel rather a dislike for her show pupil.</p>
<p class="text-left">On that first morning, when Sara sat at Miss Minchin’s side, Sara noticed one little girl, about her own age, who looked at her very hard with a pair of light blue eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was a fat child who did not look as if she were in the least clever.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her yellow hair hung down in a tight braid( 发辫 ), tied with a ribbon( 缎带 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">She had pulled this braid around her neck, and was biting the end of the ribbon, as she looked wonderingly at the new pupil.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Sara stepped forward and answered Monsieur Dufarge in French, the little girl grew quite red in surprise.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had cried hopeless tears for weeks in her efforts to remember that “la mère” meant “the mother,” and “le père” meant “the father.”</p>
<p class="text-left">It was almost too much for her to listen to a child of her own age who was not only familiar with these words, but knew many others.</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked so hard and bit the ribbon on her braid so fast that she attracted the attention of Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">The woman, who was feeling extremely cross at the moment, immediately set upon her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Miss St. John!” she cried out.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What do you mean by such conduct? Take your ribbon out of your mouth! Sit up at once!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Lavinia and Jessie laughed quietly, and Ermengarde became redder than ever.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was so red, indeed, that she almost looked as if tears were coming into her eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara saw her and was so sorry for her that she began to like her and want to be her friend. It was Sara’s way to always want to help someone who was made uncomfortable or unhappy.</p>
<p class="text-left">So she took rather a liking to little Miss St. John.</p>
<p class="text-left">She saw that lessons were no easy matter to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her French lesson was a hopeless thing.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her accent made even Monsieur Dufarge smile even though he did not want to.</p>
<p class="text-left">Lavinia and Jessie and the more fortunate girls laughed at her. But Sara did not laugh.</p>
<p class="text-left">When lessons were over, Sara looked for Miss St. John.</p>
<p class="text-left">Finding her in a window seat, she walked over to her and spoke.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What is your name?” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“My name’s Ermengarde St. John,” she answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Mine is Sara Crewe,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yours is very pretty. It sounds like a story book.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you like it?” said Ermengarde nervously. “I—I like yours.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss St. John’s chief trouble in life was that she had a clever father.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her father could speak seven or eight languages, and had thousands of books which he had almost learned by heart.</p>
<p class="text-left">As a result, he often expected his daughter to be familiar with the contents of her lesson books at least.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde was a difficult problem for Mr. St. John.</p>
<p class="text-left">He could not understand how a child of his could be a notably dull( 迟钝的 ) girl who never shone in anything.</p>
<p class="text-left">Consequently, Ermengarde spent the greater part of her life in trouble or in tears.</p>
<p class="text-left">She learned things and forgot them, or, if she remembered them, she did not understand them.</p>
<p class="text-left">So it was natural that, having met Sara, she should sit and stare at her with great admiration.</p></div>

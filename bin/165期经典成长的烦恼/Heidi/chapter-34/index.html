                        <div><p class="text-left">Being again urged( 被催促 ) to say a wish, he saw at last that he was saved from the policeman.</p>
<p class="text-left">He felt as if the most terrible fear had left him.</p>
<p class="text-left">He knew now that it was better to confess( 承认 ) at once, when something had gone wrong, so he said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have also lost the paper.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Thinking for a while, the grandmama understood and said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“That is right. Always confess what is wrong, then it can be settled( 被解决 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">And now, what would you like to have?”</p>
<p class="text-left">So Peter could choose everything in the world he wished. His brain got dizzy( 晕眩的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He saw before him all the wonderful things in the fair in Mayenfeld.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had often stood there for hours, looking at the pretty red whistles( 口哨 ) and the little knives;</p>
<p class="text-left">unfortunately( 不幸地 ) Peter had never possessed( 拥有 ) enough money to buy half of those objects.</p>
<p class="text-left">He stood thinking, not able to decide, when a bright thought struck him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Ten cents,” said Peter with decision.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That certainly is not too much,” the old lady said with a smile.</p>
<p class="text-left">She took a bank note out of her pocket, on top of which she laid twenty cents.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now I’ll explain this to you. You will have ten cents every week of the year.</p>
<p class="text-left">You’ll be able to spend them every Sunday through the year.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“All my life?” Peter asked quite innocently( 天真地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Laughingly she said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“You shall have it, my boy.</p>
<p class="text-left">I will put it in my will and then you will do the same, my son. Listen!</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter the goatherd( 牧羊人 ) shall have a ten-cent piece weekly as long as he lives.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter, looking at his gift, said seriously,</p>
<p class="text-left">“God be thanked!” Jumping up, he ran away.</p>
<p class="text-left">His heart was so light that he felt he could fly.</p>
<p class="text-left">A little later the whole party sat round the table, holding a dinner to celebrate.</p>
<p class="text-left">After dinner, Clara, who was lively as never before, said to her father:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Papa, if you only knew all the things grandfather did for me.</p>
<p class="text-left">It would take many days to tell you; I shall never forget them all my life.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, if we could please him only half as much as what he did for me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is my greatest wish, too, dear child,” said her father;</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have been trying to think of something all the time.</p>
<p class="text-left">We have to show our gratitude( 感激 ) in some way.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Accordingly, Mr. Sesemann walked over to the old man, and began:</p>
<p class="text-left">“My dear friend, may I say one word to you?</p>
<p class="text-left">I am sure you believe me when I tell you that I have not known any real joy( 欢乐 ) for years.</p>
<p class="text-left">My wealth was nothing to me when I could not help my child and make her happy!</p>
<p class="text-left">You have given her a new life. Please tell me how to thank you.</p>
<p class="text-left">I know I shall never be able to repay( 报答 ) you, but I shall do everything in my power to try it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Can I do anything for you? Please let me know.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle had listened quietly and had looked at the happy father.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Mr. Sesemann, you can be sure that I am also repaid by the great joy I experience at seeing Clara get better,”</p>
<p class="text-left">said the uncle firmly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I thank you for your kind offer, Mr. Sesemann.</p>
<p class="text-left">As long as I live, I have enough for me and the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I have one wish.</p>
<p class="text-left">If this could be fulfilled( 实现 ), my life would be free of care.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Speak, my dear friend,” said Clara’s father.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am old,” continued the uncle,</p>
<p class="text-left">“and shall not live many years. When I die I cannot leave Heidi anything.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you promise me that Heidi will never have to go into the world and earn( 赚 ) her bread,</p>
<p class="text-left">you would repay me for what I was able to do for you and Clara.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“My dear friend, there is no question of that,” began Mr. Sesemann;</p>
<p class="text-left">“the child belongs to( 属于 ) us! I promise at once that we shall look after her.</p>
<p class="text-left">We all know that she is not suited( 适合 ) to live a life away from home.</p>
<p class="text-left">Still, she has made some true friends, and one of them will be here very shortly.</p>
<p class="text-left">The doctor is just now completing his last business in Frankfurt.</p>
<p class="text-left">He plans to take your advice and live here.</p>
<p class="text-left">He has never felt so happy as with you and Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">The child will have two protectors near her,</p>
<p class="text-left">and I hope with God’s will, that they may live a long, long time.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmama now put her arms around the child and said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Heidi, I want to know if you also have a wish?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes indeed, I have,” said Heidi, pleased.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Tell me what it is, child!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I should like to have my bed from Frankfurt with the three high pillows( 枕头 ) and the thick, warm cover.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then grandmother will be able to keep warm and won’t have to wear her scarf in bed.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh dear, I had nearly forgotten what I meant to do.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am so glad you have reminded( 提醒 ) me, Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">I shall ask immediately for the bed, and if Miss Rottenmeier sends it off at once, it can be here in two days.</p>
<p class="text-left">I hope the poor blind grandmother will sleep better when it comes.”</p></div>

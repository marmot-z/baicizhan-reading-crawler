                        <div><p class="text-left">LOCK WILLOW( 柳树 ) FARM,</p>
<p class="text-left">Saturday night</p>
<p class="text-left">Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve only just arrived and I haven’t unpacked( 打开行李 ), but I can’t wait to tell you how much I like farms.</p>
<p class="text-left">This is a heavenly( 天堂般的 ), heavenly, )heavenly place!</p>
<p class="text-left">The house is square like this:</p>
<p class="text-left">And old. A hundred years or so.</p>
<p class="text-left">It stands on the top of a hill and looks way off over miles of green fields to another line of hills.</p>
<p class="text-left">The people on the farm are Mr. and Mrs. Semple, a hired( 被雇佣的 ) girl, and two hired men.</p>
<p class="text-left">The hired people eat in the kitchen, and the Semples and I in the dining room.</p>
<p class="text-left">We had ham( 火腿 ) and eggs and biscuits and honey( 蜂蜜 ) and cake and pie and tea for dinner—and there was a lot of talk as well.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have never been so entertaining( 开心的 ) in my life; everything I say appears to be funny.</p>
<p class="text-left">I suppose it is because I’ve never been in the country before, and I know nothing at all.</p>
<p class="text-left">The room marked with a cross is not where the murder( 谋杀 ) was done; it’s the one I’m staying in.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s big and square and empty.</p>
<p class="text-left">It has lovely old furniture( 家具 ), and windows that have to be kept open with sticks.</p>
<p class="text-left">And a big square wooden table—I’m going to spend the summer with my elbows( 胳膊肘 ) on it, writing a novel( 小说 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, Daddy, I’m so excited!</p>
<p class="text-left">I can’t wait till daylight; I want to look around so much.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s 8.30 in the evening now, and I am about to blow out my candle and try to go to sleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">We rise at five.</p>
<p class="text-left">Did you ever know such fun?</p>
<p class="text-left">I can’t believe this is really Judy.</p>
<p class="text-left">You and the Good Lord give me more than I deserve( 应得 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I must try to be a very, very, very good person to deserve this.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m going to be. You’ll see.</p>
<p class="text-left">Good night,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S. You should hear the frogs( 青蛙 ) sing, and the little pigs squeal( 尖叫 ), and you should see the new moon!</p>
<p class="text-left">I saw it over my right shoulder.</p>
<p class="text-left">LOCK WILLOW,</p>
<p class="text-left">July 12th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">How did your secretary come to know about Lock Willow? (That isn’t a rhetorical( 修辞学的 ) question. I really want to know.)</p>
<p class="text-left">Listen to this: Mr. Jervis Pendleton used to own this farm, but now he has given it to Mrs. Semple, who was his old nurse.</p>
<p class="text-left">Did you ever hear of such a funny coincidence( 巧合 )?</p>
<p class="text-left">She still calls him “Master( 老爷 ) Jervie” and talks about what a sweet little boy he used to be.</p>
<p class="text-left">She has a piece of his baby hair put away in a box, and it is red—or at least reddish!</p>
<p class="text-left">Since she discovered that I know him, I have risen very much in her opinion.</p>
<p class="text-left">Knowing a member of the Pendleton family is the best introduction one can have at Lock Willow.</p>
<p class="text-left">And the best of the whole family is Master Jervis—I am pleased to say that Julia belongs( 属于 ) to an inferior( 较低等的 ) branch( 分支 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The farm gets more and more fun.</p>
<p class="text-left">I rode on a hay wagon( 运干草的货车 ) yesterday.</p>
<p class="text-left">We have three big pigs and nine little piglets, and you should see them eat.</p>
<p class="text-left">They are pigs!</p>
<p class="text-left">We have hundreds of little baby chickens and ducks and so on.</p>
<p class="text-left">You must be mad to live in a city when you might live on a farm.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is my daily business to find and collect the eggs.</p>
<p class="text-left">I fell off a beam( 梁 ) in the barn( 谷仓 ) yesterday.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was trying to crawl( 爬行 ) over to a nest( 窝 ) that the black hen has made there.</p>
<p class="text-left">And when I came in with a scratched( 被划破的 ) knee, Mrs. Semple bandaged( 包扎 ) it, saying, “Dear! Dear! It seems only yesterday that Master Jervie fell off that very same beam and scratched this very same knee.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The scenery around here is perfectly beautiful.</p>
<p class="text-left">There’s a valley( 山谷 ) and a river and a lot of wooded( 长满树的 ) hills, and far off in the distance a tall blue mountain.</p>
<p class="text-left">We make cream( 奶油 ) twice a week.</p>
<p class="text-left">We keep it in the spring house, which is made of stone with a stream( 小溪 ) running underneath.</p>
<p class="text-left">Some of the farmers around here have a separator( 分离器 ), but we don’t care for these new ideas.</p>
<p class="text-left">It may be a little harder to separate the cream by hand, but it tastes so much better.</p>
<p class="text-left">We have six calves( 牛犊 ); and I’ve chosen the names for all of them.</p>
<p class="text-left">1. Sylvia, because she was born in the woods.</p>
<p class="text-left">2. Lesbia, after the Lesbia in Catullus’ poems.</p>
<p class="text-left">3. Sallie.</p>
<p class="text-left">4. Julia—a rather boring animal.</p>
<p class="text-left">5. Judy, after me.</p>
<p class="text-left">6.Daddy-Long-Legs.</p>
<p class="text-left">You don’t mind, do you, Daddy?</p>
<p class="text-left">He’s pure Jersey( 典型的泽西牛 ) and has a sweet character.</p>
<p class="text-left">He looks like this—you can see how appropriate( 合适 ) the name is.</p>
<p class="text-left">I haven’t had time yet to begin my famous novel; the farm keeps me too busy.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours always,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S. (1) I’ve learned to make doughnuts( 甜甜圈 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S. (2) I wish I could send you some of the nice, fresh butter( 黄油 ) I made yesterday. I’m a fine dairymaid( 挤奶工 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">P.S. (3) This is a picture of Miss Jerusha Abbott, the future great author, driving home the cows.</p></div>

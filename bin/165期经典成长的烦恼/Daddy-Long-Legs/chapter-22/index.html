<p class="text-left">Daddy! Daddy! What do you think?</p>
<p class="text-left">The postman has just come with two letters.</p>
<p class="text-left">1st. My story is accepted. $50.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m an AUTHOR.</p>
<p class="text-left">2nd. A letter from the college secretary.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m to have a scholarship( 奖学金 ) for two years that will cover board and tuition( 学费 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It is for “outstanding( 杰出的 ) ability in English with general excellence in other subjects.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And I’ve won it! I applied for( 申请 ) it before I left, but I had no idea I’d get it.</p>
<p class="text-left">It seems I’ve made up for failing Latin( 拉丁语 ) and mathematics in my first year.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m so glad, Daddy, because now I won’t be such a burden( 负担 ) to you.</p>
<p class="text-left">The monthly allowance( 零用钱 ) will be all I’ll need, and maybe I can earn( 挣 ) that with writing or teaching or something.</p>
<p class="text-left">I want so much to go back and begin work.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours ever,</p>

<p class="text-left">September 26th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Back at college again and a third-year student.</p>
<p class="text-left">Our rooms are better than ever this year—they face South, with two huge windows.</p>
<p class="text-left">We have new wall paper and carpets( 地毯 ) and proper wooden chairs.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s lovely, but I don’t feel as though I belong( 属于… ) in it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m always afraid I’ll get an ink spot( 墨点 ) in the wrong place.</p>
<p class="text-left">And, Daddy, I found your letter waiting for me—pardon—I mean your secretary’s.</p>
<p class="text-left">Will you please give me a proper reason why I shouldn’t accept that scholarship?</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t understand your objection in the least.</p>
<p class="text-left">But anyway, it won’t do the slightest good for you to object.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve already accepted it and I am not going to change!</p>
<p class="text-left">That sounds a little disrespectful( 不尊敬的 ), but I don’t mean it so.</p>
<p class="text-left">I suppose you feel that you set out to educate me, and you’d like to finish the work.</p>
<p class="text-left">You want to put a neat( 整齐的 ) period, in the shape of a degree, at the end.</p>
<p class="text-left">But look at it from my point of view.</p>
<p class="text-left">I shall still owe( 欠 ) my education to you.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I won’t be quite so much in debt( 债务 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I know that you don’t want me to return the money.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I want to do it, if I possibly can.</p>
<p class="text-left">Winning this scholarship makes it so much easier.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was expecting to spend the rest of my life in paying you back.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now I shall only have to spend half of the rest of it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I hope you understand my position and won’t be angry.</p>
<p class="text-left">I shall still most gratefully( 感激地 ) accept the allowance.</p>
<p class="text-left">I need an allowance to live with Julia!</p>
<p class="text-left">I wish that she had simpler tastes, or else that she were not my roommate( 室友 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Good night, Daddy dear, and don’t be angry because your chick( 小鸡 ) wants to scratch( 抓刨 ) for herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">She’s growing up into a very energetic little hen—with a very determined( 坚决的 ) cluck( 咯咯叫 ) and lots of beautiful feathers( 羽毛 ) (all due to you).</p>
<p class="text-left">Love,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">September 30th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy,</p>
<p class="text-left">Are you still going on about that scholarship?</p>
<p class="text-left">I never knew a man as stubborn( 固执 ) as you.</p>
<p class="text-left">You say that I should not be accepting favors from strangers.</p>
<p class="text-left">Strangers!—And what are you, may I ask?</p>
<p class="text-left">Is there anyone in the world that I know less?</p>
<p class="text-left">I shouldn’t know you if I met you in the street.</p>
<p class="text-left">A normal( 正常的 ) person would have written nice, cheering fatherly letters to your little Judy.</p>
<p class="text-left">He would have come occasionally and patted( 拍 ) her on the head, and said he was glad she was such a good girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you’d done that, then perhaps she wouldn’t have gone against you in your old age.</p>
<p class="text-left">Perhaps she would have obeyed( 遵守 ) your slightest wish, like the dutiful daughter she was meant to be.</p>
<p class="text-left">Strangers indeed!</p>
<p class="text-left">You live in a glass house, Mr. Smith.</p>
<p class="text-left">And besides, this isn’t a favor.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s like a prize—I earned it by hard work.</p>
<p class="text-left">Also—but what’s the use of arguing with a man?</p>
<p class="text-left">You belong, Mr. Smith, to an illogical( 不合逻辑的 ) sex.</p>
<p class="text-left">There are just two methods to deal with a man.</p>
<p class="text-left">One must either sweet-talk them, or be disagreeable.</p>
<p class="text-left">I will not sweet-talk men, so I must be disagreeable.</p>
<p class="text-left">I refuse, sir, to give up the scholarship.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you complain( 抱怨 ) any more, I won’t accept the monthly allowance either, but will wear myself out teaching stupid first-year girls.</p>
<p class="text-left">That is my last word on the subject!</p>
<p class="text-left">And I have another thought.</p>
<p class="text-left">Since you are so afraid that by taking this scholarship, I am preventing( 防止 ) someone else from getting an education, I know a way out.</p>
<p class="text-left">You can use the money that you would have spent for me to educate some other little girl from the John Grier Home.</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t you think that’s a nice idea?</p>
<p class="text-left">Only, Daddy, educate the new girl as much as you choose, but please don’t like her any better than me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I hope that your secretary won’t be hurt, because I pay so little attention to the suggestions offered in his letter.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I can’t help it if he is.</p>
<p class="text-left">He’s a spoiled( 被宠坏的 ) child, Daddy.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’ve given in to him so far, but this time I intend( 打算 ) to be firm.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours,</p>
<p class="text-left">With a mind completely made up,</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">November 9th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Julia Pendleton has invited me to visit her for the Christmas holidays.</p>
<p class="text-left">How does that strike you, Mr. Smith?</p>
<p class="text-left">Imagine Jerusha Abbott, of the John Grier Home, sitting at the tables of the rich! I don’t know why Julia wants me—she seems to be getting quite fond of( 喜欢 ) me.</p>
<p class="text-left">To tell the truth, I would much rather go to Sallie’s, but Julia asked me first.</p>
<p class="text-left">So if I go anywhere, it must be to New York( 纽约，地名 ) instead of to Worcester( 伍斯特，地名 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The idea of meeting all the Pendletons at once scares( 使…害怕 ) me somewhat, and also I’d have to get a lot of new clothes.</p>
<p class="text-left">So, Daddy dear, if you write that you want me to remain quietly at college, I will agree to your wishes just as sweetly and willingly as I always do.</p></div>

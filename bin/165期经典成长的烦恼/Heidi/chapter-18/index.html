                        <div><p class="text-left">The lady, who was waiting eagerly( 急切地 ), heard the tale( 故事 ) and immediately sat down to write to Mr. Sesemann.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann arrived shortly after. Going to his daughter’s room after his arrival, he was very happy to see her as well as ever.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What new tricks( 把戏 ) has the ghost( 鬼 ) played on you, Miss Rottenmeier?” asked Mr. Sesemann with a twinkle( 闪光 ) in his eye.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is no joke, Mr. Sesemann,” replied the lady seriously.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am sure you will not laugh tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann decided to figure out what happened at night himself.</p>
<p class="text-left">He called his friend, a doctor, who arrived exactly at nine o’clock.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann explained to the doctor that a ghost was coming to the house every night.</p>
<p class="text-left">He said that the matter was probably a bad joke that a friend of the servants was playing in his absence.</p>
<p class="text-left">It could also be that somebody was trying to break into the house to steal something.</p>
<p class="text-left">With these explanations, they entered the room where the two servants had watched before.</p>
<p class="text-left">They left the door only partly open, for too much light might drive the ghost away.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then, sitting down comfortably, the two men passed their time by chatting( 聊天 ) and drinking every now and then.</p>
<p class="text-left">They talked till one o’clock.</p>
<p class="text-left">Everything was quiet, and not a sound came from the street. Suddenly the doctor raised his finger.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Sh! Sesemann, don’t you hear something?”</p>
<p class="text-left">While they both listened, the key was turned, and the door flew open.</p>
<p class="text-left">On the other side stood a motionless( 静止的 ) white form, lighted up by the moon.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Who is there?” thundered( 怒吼 ) the doctor, approaching the figure.</p>
<p class="text-left">It turned and screamed( 尖叫 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">There stood Heidi, with bare( 赤裸的 ) feet and in her white nightgown( 睡衣 ), looking confused( 疑惑的 ) at the bright light.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was shaking with fear, while the two men were looking at her in amazement( 惊愕 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Child, what does this mean?” asked Mr. Sesemann.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What did you want to do? Why have you come down here?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Pale from fright( 恐惧 ), Heidi said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don't know.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The doctor came forward now.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Sesemann, this case belongs to( 属于 ) my field. Please go and sit down while I take her to bed.”</p>
<p class="text-left">He led the trembling( 哆嗦的 ) child upstairs( 上楼 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Don’t be afraid; just be quiet! Everything is all right; don’t be frightened( 感到害怕的 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">When they had arrived in Heidi’s room, the doctor put the little girl to bed, covering her up carefully.</p>
<p class="text-left">Drawing a chair near her, he waited till Heidi had calmed down( 冷静下来 ) and had stopped trembling.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then taking her hand in his, he said kindly,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now everything is all right again. Tell me where you wanted to go?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I did not want to go anywhere,” Heidi told him;</p>
<p class="text-left">“I did not go myself, only I was there all of a sudden.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Really! Tell me, what did you dream?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, I have the same dream every night.</p>
<p class="text-left">I always think I am with my grandfather again and can hear the fir( 冷杉 ) trees roar( 咆哮 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I always think how beautiful the stars must be, and then I open the door of the hut( 小屋 ), and oh, it is so wonderful!</p>
<p class="text-left">But when I wake up I am always in Frankfurt.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Does your back or your head hurt you, child?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No, but I feel as if a big stone was pressing me here.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“As if you had eaten something that disagreed with( 使…身体不适 ) you?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh no, but as if I wanted to cry hard.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“So, and then you cry out, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh no, I must never do that, for Miss Rottenmeier has forbidden( 禁止 ) it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Then you swallow it down( 吞下 )? Yes? Do you like to be here?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh yes,” was the quiet, uncertain reply.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Where did you live with your grandfather?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Up on the Alp.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But wasn’t it a little lonely there?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh no, it was so beautiful!” But Heidi could say no more.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thinking about the Alp, all the restrained( 抑制的 ) sorrow( 伤心 ) overpowered( 压倒 ) the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">The tears( 眼泪 ) rushed violently( 猛烈地 ) from her eyes and she broke out into loud sobs( 啜泣 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The doctor rose and comforted her.</p>
<p class="text-left">He said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“It won’t hurt to cry; you’ll go to sleep afterward( 之后 ), and when you wake up everything will come right.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he left the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">Joining his anxious( 焦虑的 ) friend downstairs( 下楼 ), he said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Sesemann, the little girl is a sleepwalker( 梦游病者 ), and has accidentally( 偶然地 ) scared( 使惊吓 ) your whole household( 家人 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Besides, she is so homesick( 思乡的 ) that her little body has wasted away( 逐渐消瘦 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">We shall have to act quickly.</p>
<p class="text-left">The only solution for her is to be brought back to the mountain air where she came from.</p>
<p class="text-left">She must go tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When Mr. Sesemann heard this, he said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“If that is your advice, we must act at once; this is the only way then.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When everything was settled( 处理好 ), the doctor took his leave, for the morning had already come and the sun was shining in through the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Sesemann, going upstairs in great anxiety( 处于焦虑中 ), knocked at the housekeeper’s door.</p>
<p class="text-left">He asked her to hurry, for preparations for a journey had to be made.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Rottenmeier was instructed to quickly pack( 打包 ) a trunk( 旅行箱 ) for Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">Clara had been wakened by the unusual noises and was listening eagerly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her father told her of what had happened and how the doctor had ordered Heidi back to her home,</p>
<p class="text-left">because her condition was serious and might get worse.</p>
<p class="text-left">She might even climb the roof( 屋顶 ), or be exposed( 被暴露在 ) to similar dangers, if she was not cured( 被治愈 ) at once.</p></div>

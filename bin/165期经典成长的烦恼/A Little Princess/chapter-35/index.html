                        <div><p class="text-left">One evening, Mr. Carrisford, looking up from his book, noticed that his companion had not moved for some time, but sat looking into the fire.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What are you thinking, Sara?” he asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara looked up, with a bright color on her cheek.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I was remembering that hungry day, and a child I saw.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she told him the story of the bun shop, the fourpence she picked up out of the mud, and the child who was hungrier than herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">She told it quite simply, but the Indian gentleman was moved by her kindness.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she had finished, she added, “I was thinking I should like to do something.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“What was it?” said Mr. Carrisford, in a low tone.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You may do anything you like to do, princess.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I was wondering,” said Sara—“you know, you say I have so much money—I was wondering if I could go to see the bun-woman.</p>
<p class="text-left">I could ask her to help the hungry children.</p>
<p class="text-left">On cold days, when they sit on the steps, or look in at the window, she could just call them in and give them something to eat.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she might send the bills to me.</p>
<p class="text-left">Could I do that?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You shall do it tomorrow morning,” said the Indian gentleman.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Thank you,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You see, I know what it is to be hungry, and it is very hard when one cannot even pretend it away.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The next morning, Miss Minchin, in looking out of her window, saw the things she perhaps least enjoyed seeing.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Indian gentleman’s carriage drew up before the door of the next house.</p>
<p class="text-left">Its owner and a little figure walked down the steps to get into it.</p>
<p class="text-left">The little figure was a familiar one, and reminded Miss Minchin of days in the past.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was followed by another as familiar—the sight of which she found very maddening.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was Becky, who always went with her young employer to her carriage, carrying wraps( 外衣 ) and belongings.</p>
<p class="text-left">Already Becky had a pink, round face.</p>
<p class="text-left">A little later the carriage drew up before the door of the baker’s shop, and the man and the child got out.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Sara entered the shop, the woman turned and looked at her from behind the counter.</p>
<p class="text-left">For a moment she looked at Sara very hard indeed, and then her kind face lighted up.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’m sure that I remember you, miss,” she said. “And yet—”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” said Sara; “once you gave me six buns for fourpence, and—”</p>
<p class="text-left">“And you gave five of them to a beggar child,” the woman interrupted her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’ve always remembered it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She turned around to the Indian gentleman and spoke her next words to him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I beg your pardon, sir, but there’s not many young people that notices a hungry face, and I’ve thought of it many a time.</p>
<p class="text-left">Excuse me, miss,”—to Sara—“but you look healthier and—well, better than you did that—that—”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am better, thank you,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And—I am much happier—and I have come to ask you to do something for me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Me, miss!” said the bun-woman, smiling cheerfully.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why, bless you! Yes, miss. What can I do?”</p>
<p class="text-left">And then Sara, leaning on the counter, made her little request concerning the cold days and the hungry children and the buns.</p>
<p class="text-left">The woman listened with a surprised face.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why, it’ll be a pleasure to me to do it,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I cannot afford to do much on my own account.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I’ve given away many a bit of bread since that wet afternoon, just thinking of you—and how hungry you looked.</p>
<p class="text-left">And yet you gave away your hot buns as if you were a princess.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The Indian gentleman smiled at this.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara smiled a little, too, remembering what she had said to herself when she gave the buns to the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She looked so hungry,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She was even hungrier than I was.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“She was starving,” said the woman.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She’s told me about it many times.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, have you seen her since then?” asked Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you know where she is?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, I do,” answered the woman, smiling more kindly than ever.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why, she’s in that back room, miss, and has been there for a month.</p>
<p class="text-left">She’s a good, well-meaning girl, and such a help to me in the shop and in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="text-left">You’d hardly believe it, knowing how she’s lived.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She stepped to the door of the little back parlor and spoke, and the next minute a girl came out.</p>
<p class="text-left">And really it was the beggar child, clean and nicely clothed, and looking as if she had not been hungry for a long time.</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked shy, but she had a nice face, and the wild look had gone from her eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">She knew Sara in an instant, and stood and looked at her as if she could never look enough.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You see,” said the woman, “I’ve given her a place and a home.</p>
<p class="text-left">She helps me, and behaves well, and is as thankful as a girl can be.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her name’s Anne.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The children stood and looked at each other for a few minutes.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then Sara took her hand and held it out across the counter.</p>
<p class="text-left">Anne took it, and they looked straight into each other’s eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am so glad,” Sara said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And I have just thought of something.</p>
<p class="text-left">Perhaps your mistress( 女主人 ) will let you be the one to give the buns and bread to the children.</p>
<p class="text-left">Perhaps you would like to do it because you know what it is to be hungry, too.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, miss,” said the girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">And, somehow, Sara felt as if she understood her, though she said so little.</p>
<p class="text-left">Anne only stood still and looked, and looked after Sara as she went out of the shop with the Indian gentleman.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then they got into the carriage and drove away.</p>
<p class="text-left">THE END</p></div>

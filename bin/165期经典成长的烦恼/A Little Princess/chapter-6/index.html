                        <div><p class="text-left">“You can speak French, can’t you?” she said respectfully.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara sat next to her on the window seat.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I can speak it because I have heard it all my life,” she answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You could speak it if you had always heard it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde paused a moment, and then added with a touch of wonder in her voice, “You are clever, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara looked out of the window and thought for a few moments.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had heard it said very often that she was “clever,” and she wondered if she was.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t know,” she said. “I can’t tell.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then, seeing a sad look on the round face, she gave a little laugh and changed the subject.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Would you like to see Emily?” she asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Who is Emily?” Ermengarde asked, just as Miss Minchin had done.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come up to my room and see,” said Sara, holding out her hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">They jumped down from the window seat together, and went upstairs.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is it true,” Ermengarde whispered, as they went through the hall—“is it true that you have a playroom( 娱乐室 ) all to yourself?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” Sara answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Papa asked Miss Minchin to let me have one, because when I play I make up stories and tell them to myself.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t like people to hear me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You make up stories!” Ermengarde said with surprise.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Can you do that—as well as speak French? Can you?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why, anyone can make up things,” she said. “Have you never tried?”</p>
<p class="text-left">She put her hand on Ermengarde’s.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Let us go very quietly to the door,” she whispered, “and then I will open it quite suddenly; perhaps we may catch her.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde did not have any idea what it meant, or whom it was she wanted to “catch,” or why she wanted to catch her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Whatever she meant, Ermengarde was sure it was something exciting.</p>
<p class="text-left">They made not the least noise until they reached the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then Sara suddenly turned the handle, and threw it wide open.</p>
<p class="text-left">They saw the quiet room, and a wonderful doll sitting in a chair, who appeared to be reading a book.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, she got back to her seat before we could see her!” Sara explained.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Of course they always do. They are as quick as lightning.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde looked from her to the doll and back again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Can she—walk?” she asked excitedly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” answered Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“At least I pretend she can. Have you never pretended things?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No,” said Ermengarde. “Never. I—tell me about it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Let us sit down,” said Sara, “and I will tell you. It’s so easy that when you begin you can’t stop.</p>
<p class="text-left">You just go on and on doing it always.</p>
<p class="text-left">And it’s beautiful. Emily, you must listen.</p>
<p class="text-left">This is Ermengarde St. John, Emily.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde, this is Emily.</p>
<p class="text-left">Would you like to hold her?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, may I?” said Ermengarde. “May I, really? She is beautiful!”</p>
<p class="text-left">And Emily was put into her arms.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss St. John had never in her short life dreamed of such an hour as the one she spent with the new pupil.</p>
<p class="text-left">But then they heard the lunch bell ring and had to go downstairs.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the two girls spent time together, Sara would sit upon the carpet and tell her strange things.</p>
<p class="text-left">She told stories of the voyage, and stories of India.</p>
<p class="text-left">What interested Ermengarde the most, however, was her idea about the dolls who walked and talked.</p>
<p class="text-left">They could do anything they chose when the humans were out of the room, but they must keep their powers a secret.</p>
<p class="text-left">So they would fly back to their places “like lightning” when people returned to the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">Once, when she was relating the story of the search for Emily, Ermengarde saw her face suddenly change.</p>
<p class="text-left">A cloud seemed to pass over it and put out the light in her shining eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">She drew her breath in so quickly that it made a sad little sound.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you have a—a pain?” Ermengarde asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” Sara answered, after a moment’s silence.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But it is not in my body.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she added something in a low voice: “Do you love your father more than anything else in all the whole world?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde’s mouth fell open a little.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I—I hardly ever see him,” she said. “He is always in the library—reading things.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I love mine more than all the world ten times over,” Sara said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That is what my pain is. He has gone away.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“She’s going to cry out loud,” thought Ermengarde, fearfully.</p>
<p class="text-left">But she did not.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I promised him I would bear it,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And I will. You have to bear things. Think what soldiers bear! Papa is a soldier.</p>
<p class="text-left">If there was a war he would have to bear marching and thirstiness and, perhaps, deep wounds.</p>
<p class="text-left">And he would never say a word—not one word.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde felt that she was beginning to like her quite a lot.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was so wonderful and different from anyone else.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Lavinia and Jessie are ‘best friends,’ ” Ermengarde said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I wish we could be ‘best friends.’ Would you have me for yours?</p>
<p class="text-left">You’re clever, and I’m the stupidest child in the school, but I—oh, I do so like you!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’m glad of that,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes. We will be friends.</p>
<p class="text-left">And I’ll tell you what”—her face lit up suddenly—“I can help you with your French lessons.”</p></div>

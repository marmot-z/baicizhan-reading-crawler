<p class="text-left">I try hard not to, but they do come out when I’m surprised—and I’m surprised most of the time.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s a strange experience, Daddy, to pass eighteen years in the John Grier Home, and then suddenly to be thrown into the wide world outside.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I’m getting used to it.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t make such awful mistakes as I did, and I don’t feel uncomfortable any more with the other girls.</p>
<p class="text-left">I used to hate it when people looked at me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I felt as though they saw right through my new clothes to the Orphans( 孤儿 )’ Home dress underneath.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I’m not letting that bother( 困扰 ) me anymore.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have no time to regret the past—I am too busy with the present.</p>
<p class="text-left">Master( 老爷 ) Jervie gave us each a big bunch( 束 ) of flowers.</p>
<p class="text-left">Wasn’t that sweet of him?</p>
<p class="text-left">I never used to care much for men—the Trustees( 董事 ) were the only ones I met—but I’m changing my mind.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours always,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">April 10th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Mr. Rich-Man,</p>
<p class="text-left">Here’s your check for fifty dollars.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thank you very much, but I do not feel that I can keep it.</p>
<p class="text-left">My allowance( 零花钱 ) is enough to pay for all of the hats that I need.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am sorry that I wrote all those silly things about the hat shop.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s just that I had never seen anything like it before.</p>
<p class="text-left">However, I wasn’t begging( 祈求 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">And I would rather not accept any more charity( 施舍 ) than I have to.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sincerely yours( 敬上 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">April 11th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dearest Daddy,</p>
<p class="text-left">Will you please forgive( 原谅 ) me for the letter I wrote you yesterday?</p>
<p class="text-left">After I posted it I was sorry, and tried to get it back, but that horrible mail clerk( 可怖的邮差 ) wouldn’t give it back to me.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s the middle of the night now; I’ve been awake for hours thinking what a bad person I am.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m sorry I was so rude( 粗鲁 ) about your check.</p>
<p class="text-left">I know you meant it kindly.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think you’re an old dear to take so much trouble for such a silly thing as a hat.</p>
<p class="text-left">I ought to have returned it very much more graciously( 亲切地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">But in any case, I had to return it.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s different with me than with other girls.</p>
<p class="text-left">They can take things naturally from people.</p>
<p class="text-left">They have fathers and brothers and aunts and uncles.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I don’t have anyone like that.</p>
<p class="text-left">I like to pretend( 假装 ) that you belong( 属于 ) to me, just to play with the idea, but of course I know you don’t.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m alone, really—with my back to the wall fighting the world—and when I think about that, I find it hard to breathe( 呼吸 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">I put it out of my mind, and keep on pretending.</p>
<p class="text-left">But don’t you see, Daddy, that I can’t accept any more money than I have to?</p>
<p class="text-left">Someday I shall want to pay it back.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’d love pretty hats and things, but I mustn’t mortgage( 抵押 ) the future to pay for them.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I sometimes seem thoughtless and ungrateful( 不感激的 ), I never mean it.</p>
<p class="text-left">In my heart I thank you always for the life and freedom and independence that you have given me.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s a quarter past two.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m going to go out to post this now.</p>
<p class="text-left">You’ll receive it in the next mail( 邮件 ) after the other, so you won’t have very long to think badly of me.</p>
<p class="text-left">Good night, Daddy,</p>
<p class="text-left">I love you always,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">May 4th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">I sat up half of last night reading Jane Eyre.</p>
<p class="text-left">Are you old enough, Daddy, to remember sixty years ago?</p>
<p class="text-left">And, if so, did people talk that way?</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s so exaggerated( 夸张的 ), but just the same, you read and read and read.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can’t see how any girl could have written such a book, especially a girl who was brought up in the grounds of a church.</p>
<p class="text-left">There’s something about those Brontes that fascinates( 迷住 ) me.</p>
<p class="text-left">Their books, their lives, their spirit.</p>
<p class="text-left">Where did they get it?</p>
<p class="text-left">When I was reading about little Jane’s troubles in the charity( 慈善 ) school, I got so angry that I had to go out and take a walk.</p>
<p class="text-left">I understood exactly how she felt.</p>
<p class="text-left">Having known Mrs. Lippett, I could see Mr. Brocklehurst.</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t be angry, Daddy.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am not saying that the John Grier Home was like the Lowood Institute( 机构 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">We had plenty to eat and plenty to wear, enough water to wash in, and there was heat.</p>
<p class="text-left">But there was one thing that was the same.</p>
<p class="text-left">Nothing nice or interesting ever happened there, except ice cream( 冰激凌 ) on Sundays.</p>
<p class="text-left">In all the eighteen years that I was there, I only had one adventure( 冒险 )—when the woodshed( 木料间 ) burned.</p>
<p class="text-left">We had to get up in the night and dress, so as to be ready in case the house should catch on fire.</p>
<p class="text-left">But it didn’t, and we went back to bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Everybody likes a few surprises; it’s a perfectly natural human desire.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I never had one, until Mrs. Lippett called me to the office to tell me that Mr. John Smith was going to send me to college.</p>
<p class="text-left">And then she broke the news so gradually( 逐渐地 ) that it was hardly even a surprise.</p></div>

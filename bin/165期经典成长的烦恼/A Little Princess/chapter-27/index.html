                        <div><p class="text-left">“Somehow, something always happens,” Sara cried, “just before things get to the very worst. It is as if the Magic did it.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I could only just remember that always.</p>
<p class="text-left">The worst thing never quite comes.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She gave Becky a little cheerful shake.</p>
<p class="text-left">“We must hurry and set the table.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Set the table, miss?” said Becky, looking round the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What’ll we set it with?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara looked round the attic, too.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There doesn’t seem to be much,” she answered, half laughing.</p>
<p class="text-left">That moment she saw something and picked it up.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was Ermengarde’s red shawl which lay upon the floor.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Here’s the shawl,” she cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I know she won’t mind it. It will make such a nice red tablecloth.”</p>
<p class="text-left">They pulled the old table forward, and threw the shawl over it.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What next, now?” said Sara, and she stood still and put her hands over her eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I must look among the things in the old trunk I had when I was a princess.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She flew to its corner and knelt down.</p>
<p class="text-left">It had not been put in the attic for her benefit, but because there was no room for it elsewhere.</p>
<p class="text-left">Nothing had been left in it but rubbish.</p>
<p class="text-left">But she knew she should find something.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Magic always arranged that kind of thing in one way or another.</p>
<p class="text-left">She found twelve small white handkerchiefs.</p>
<p class="text-left">She seized them joyfully and ran to the table.</p>
<p class="text-left">She began to arrange them upon the red table cover.</p>
<p class="text-left">“These are the plates,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“They are golden plates.</p>
<p class="text-left">These are the richly decorated( 装饰的 ) napkins( 餐巾纸 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Nuns( 修女 ) worked on them in Spain.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Did they, miss?” breathed Becky, delighted by the information.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You must pretend it,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If you pretend it enough, you will see them.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She held an old summer hat in her hand which she had fished out of the bottom of the trunk.</p>
<p class="text-left">There were flowers on it. She pulled them off.</p>
<p class="text-left">“These are flowers for the meal,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“They fill all the air with perfume.</p>
<p class="text-left">There’s a mug( 杯子 ) on the washstand( 脸盆架 ), Becky.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh—and bring the soap dish for the center of the table.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky handed them to her seriously.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What are they now, miss?” she asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“This is a carved( 精雕细琢的 ) cup,” said Sara, arranging the flowers about the mug.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And this”—bending carefully over the soap dish and covering it with roses—“is purest white stone coated with jewels.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She touched the things gently, a happy smile on her lips which made her look as if she were in a dream.</p>
<p class="text-left">“My, isn’t it lovely!” whispered Becky.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then the door opened, and Ermengarde came in, rather struggling under the weight of her basket.</p>
<p class="text-left">She started back with a cry of joy.</p>
<p class="text-left">The difference between the cold darkness outside and the totally unexpected festive table in the room, was most wonderful indeed.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Sara!” she cried out.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You are the cleverest girl I ever saw!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Isn’t it nice?” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">As the things were taken out of the basket—the cakes—the fruits—the sweets( 糖果 ) and the wine—the meal became a splendid thing.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s like a real party!” cried Ermengarde.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s like a queen’s table,” sighed Becky.</p>
<p class="text-left">They had hardly had time to take their pieces of cake into their hands when they all three sprang to their feet and turned pale faces toward the door—listening—listening.</p>
<p class="text-left">Someone was coming up the stairs.</p>
<p class="text-left">There was no mistake about it.</p>
<p class="text-left">Each of them knew the sound of the angry steps, and knew that the end of all things had come.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s—the missus!” cried Becky, and dropped her piece of cake upon the floor.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” said Sara, her eyes growing surprised and large in her small white face.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Miss Minchin has found us out.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin struck the door open with a blow of her hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was pale herself, but it was with anger.</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked from the frightened faces to the table full of food.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I knew something of this sort was going on,” she said excitedly, “but I did not dream of such bad behavior. Lavinia was telling the truth.”</p>
<p class="text-left">So they knew that it was Lavinia who had somehow guessed their secret and had told on them.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin walked over to Becky and boxed her ears for a second time.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You disobedient( 不听话的 ) creature!” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You leave the house in the morning!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara stood quite still, with her eyes growing larger, and her face turning whiter.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde began to cry.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, don’t send her away,” she cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“My aunt sent me the basket. We’re—only—having a party.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“So I see,” said Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“With the Princess Sara at the head of the table.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She turned fiercely on Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is your doing, I know,” she cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Ermengarde would never have thought of such a thing.</p>
<p class="text-left">You decorated the table, I suppose—with this rubbish.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She stamped her foot at Becky.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Go to your attic!” she said, and Becky stole away, with her shoulders shaking.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then it was Sara’s turn again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I will deal with you tomorrow.</p>
<p class="text-left">You shall have neither breakfast, dinner, nor supper!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have not had either dinner or supper today, Miss Minchin,” said Sara, rather weakly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Then all the better.</p>
<p class="text-left">You will have something to remember.</p>
<p class="text-left">Don’t stand there. Put those things into the basket again.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she quickly put the rest of the food back into the basket, gave it back to Ermengarde and pushed her toward the door.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Go to bed this instant,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">And she shut the door behind herself and poor Ermengarde, and left Sara standing quite alone.</p></div>

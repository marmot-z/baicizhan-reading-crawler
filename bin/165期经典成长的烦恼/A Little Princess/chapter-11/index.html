                        <div><p class="text-left">Lessons for the day were over, and they were sitting before the classroom fire, enjoying the time they liked best.</p>
<p class="text-left">At this hour a great deal of talking was done, and a great many secrets changed hands.</p>
<p class="text-left">Even as Lavinia spoke, the door opened and Sara entered with Lottie, whose habit was to follow everywhere after her like a little dog.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There she is, with that awful child!” said Lavinia in a whisper.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She will begin crying about something in five minutes.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Lottie joined a group of little ones who were playing in a corner.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara sat up in the window seat, opened a book, and began to read.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a book about the French Revolution( 法国大革命 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">She was soon lost in the story of the prisoners in the Bastille( 巴士底狱 )—men who had spent so many years locked up in jail( 监狱 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Lottie had been sliding( 滑行 ) across the classroom floor, and had ended by falling down and hurting her fat knee.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was screaming and dancing up and down in the middle of a group of friends and enemies.</p>
<p class="text-left">They were both trying to make her feel better and to get her to be quiet.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Stop this minute, you crybaby( 爱哭鬼 )! Stop this minute!” Lavinia commanded.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’m not a crybaby . . . I’m not!” said Lottie tearfully( 泪汪汪地 ). “Sara, Sa—ra!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara flew across the room and, lowering herself, put her arms round her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come and sit in the window seat with me,” Sara said, “and I’ll whisper a story to you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Will you?” said Lottie through her tears.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Will you—tell me—about the diamond mines?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“The diamond mines?” broke out Lavinia.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Nasty( 可恶的 ), little spoiled thing, I should like to hit her!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara got up quickly on her feet.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was not an angel, and she did not like Lavinia.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Well,” she said, with some fire, “I should like to hit you—but I won’t hit you. We are both old enough to know better.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Here was Lavinia’s opportunity.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Ah, yes, your royal highness,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“We are princesses, I believe. At least one of us is.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara started toward her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked as if she were going to box Lavinia’s ears.</p>
<p class="text-left">Perhaps she was.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her trick of pretending things was the joy of her life.</p>
<p class="text-left">She never spoke of it to girls she disliked.</p>
<p class="text-left">She felt the blood rush up into her face and ring in her ears.</p>
<p class="text-left">She only just saved herself. If you were a princess, you did not show that you were angry.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her hand dropped, and she stood quite still a moment.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she spoke, it was in a quiet voice; she held her head up, and everybody listened to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s true,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Sometimes I do pretend I am a princess, so that I can try and behave like one.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Dear me,” Lavinia said, “I hope, when you become a queen, you won’t forget us!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I won’t,” said Sara, and she looked at Lavinia firmly, until Lavinia took Jessie’s arm and turned away.</p>
<p class="text-left">After this, the girls who were jealous of her called her “Princess Sara” whenever they wished to be unkind.</p>
<p class="text-left">But those who were fond of her gave her the name as a term of love.</p>
<p class="text-left">To Becky it seemed the most fitting thing in the world.</p>
<p class="text-left">Their friendship had grown, though Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia knew very little about it.</p>
<p class="text-left">They were aware that Sara was “kind” to the scullery maid.</p>
<p class="text-left">But they knew nothing of certain delightful moments when, after Becky was done cleaning the upstairs rooms, she would come to Sara’s sitting room.</p>
<p class="text-left">The heavy coal box was set down with a sigh of joy, and stories were told.</p>
<p class="text-left">Food was either eaten or quickly put into pockets for later that night, when Becky went upstairs to her attic( 阁楼 ) to bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But I must eat carefully, miss,” she said once, “because if I leave crumbs( 碎屑 ), the rats come out to get them.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Rats!” cried out Sara, in fear. “Are there rats there?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Lots of them, miss,” Becky answered in quite a matter-of-fact manner.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There are rats and mice in attics. You get used to the noise they make when they move about.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Ugh!” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You get used to anything over time,” said Becky.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You have to, miss, if you’re born a scullery maid. I’d rather have rats than cockroaches( 蟑螂 ).”</p>
<p class="text-left">“So would I,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I suppose you might make friends with a rat in time.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t believe I should like to make friends with a cockroach.”</p>
<p class="text-left">A few weeks before Sara’s eleventh birthday, a letter came to her from her father, which was not written in such high spirits as usual.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was not very well, and was weighed down by the business of the diamond mines.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You see, little Sara,” he wrote, “your daddy is not a businessman at all, and figures trouble him.</p>
<p class="text-left">He does not really understand them, and all this seems so huge.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have been feverish, turning about in bed one half of the night and the other half spent in troublesome dreams.</p>
<p class="text-left">If my little missus were here, I know she would give me some serious, good advice.</p>
<p class="text-left">You would, wouldn’t you, Little Missus?”</p>
<p class="text-left">One of his many jokes had been to call her his “little missus” because she had such an old-fashioned air.</p></div>

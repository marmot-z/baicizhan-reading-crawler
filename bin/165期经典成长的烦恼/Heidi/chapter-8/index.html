                        <div><p class="text-left">It always made Peter unhappy when Heidi did not come along, for he hardly knew how to pass his time,</p>
<p class="text-left">and besides, he did not get his extra( 额外的 ) lunch.</p>
<p class="text-left">The goats were so used to Heidi by this time that they did not follow Peter when she was not with him.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi herself did not mind staying at home, for she loved watching her grandfather with his saw and hammer( 锤子 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He would walk around the hut, fastening( 加固 ) a nail( 钉子 ) or a loose( 松的 ) board here and there.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sometimes the grandfather would make small round cheeses( 奶酪 ) on those days.</p>
<p class="text-left">There was no greater pleasure for Heidi than to see him mix the butter( 黄油 ) with his bare( 赤裸的 ) arms.</p>
<p class="text-left">The weather got colder and colder, and at last even Peter could not come anymore, for a deep snow had fallen overnight( 突然 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It kept on snowing till it reached the windows, and soon the windows could not be opened, and they were all shut in.</p>
<p class="text-left">When it had lasted for several days, Heidi thought that it would soon cover up the cottage( 乡间小屋 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It finally stopped, and the grandfather went out to clean the snow from the door and windows.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the afternoon the two were sitting near the fire when noisy steps were heard outside and the door was pushed open.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was Peter, who had come up to see Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">He said, “Good evening,” in a low voice and went up to the fire.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Well, how is it going with you?” said the grandfather. “Now that it has gotten colder and you can't go out with the goats anymore, you will have to turn to your pen and pencil."</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why must he turn to his pen and pencil?” asked Heidi immediately, full of curiosity.</p>
<p class="text-left">“During the winter he must go to school,” explained her grandfather, “and learn how to read and write; it's a bit hard, but useful sometimes afterwards.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was so interested that she asked him a hundred questions.</p>
<p class="text-left">Poor Peter, who was not an easy talker, found himself in great difficulty answering the little girl’s questions.</p>
<p class="text-left">It had begun to get dark.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter had said goodbye and thank you, when turning to Heidi he remarked( 说 ):</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’ll come next Sunday, if I may.</p>
<p class="text-left">By the way, Heidi, grandmother asked me to tell you that she would love to see you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi thought this was a good idea, and her first word next morning was:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandfather, I must go down to grandmother. She is expecting me.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Four days later the sun was shining and the frozen( 冰冻的 ) snow was crackling( 噼啪作响 ) under every step.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi in her pleasure was running from here to there:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandfather, come out! Oh, look at the trees! They are all covered with silver and gold,”</p>
<p class="text-left">she called to the grandfather, who had just come out of his working place with a wide sled( 雪橇 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Wrapping( 包 ) the child up in her cover, he put her on the sled, holding her fast.</p>
<p class="text-left">Off they started at such a pace( 速度 ) that Heidi shouted for joy( 欢乐 ), for she seemed to be flying like a bird.</p>
<p class="text-left">The sled had stopped in front of Peter’s hut, and grandfather said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Go in. When it gets dark, start on your way home.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When he had taken off her cover, he went home with his sled.</p>
<p class="text-left">Opening the door, Heidi found herself in a tiny, dark kitchen.</p>
<p class="text-left">Going through another door, she entered a narrow( 狭小的 ) room.</p>
<p class="text-left">Near a table a woman was seated, busy with mending( 修补 ) Peter’s coat, which Heidi had recognized( 认出 ) immediately.</p>
<p class="text-left">A bent( 驼背的 ) old woman was sitting in a corner, and Heidi, approaching her at once, said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“How do you do, grandmother? I hope I haven’t kept you waiting too long!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Lifting her head, the grandmother sought( 寻找 ) for Heidi’s hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">Feeling it thoughtfully, she said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are you the little girl who lives up with the uncle? Is your name Heidi?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” Heidi replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The grandfather just brought me down in the sled.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“How is it possible? Your hands are as warm as toast( 烤面包片 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">Brigida, did the uncle really come down with the child?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Brigida, Peter’s mother, had gotten up to look at the child. She said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t know if he did, but I don’t think so. She probably doesn’t know.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi, looking up, said quite decidedly:</p>
<p class="text-left">“I know that grandfather put a cover around me when we came down together.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Peter was right,” said the grandmother.</p>
<p class="text-left">“We never thought the child would live more than three weeks with him.</p>
<p class="text-left">Brigida, tell me what she looks like.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“She has Adelheid’s fine arms and legs and black eyes, and she has hair like Tobias.</p>
<p class="text-left">I think she looks like both of them.”</p>
<p class="text-left">While the women were talking, Heidi had been taking in everything.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandmother, look at the shutter( 百叶窗 ) over there.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is not fastened( 被拉好 ). If grandfather were here, he would fasten it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“What a sweet child you are,” said the grandmother tenderly( 温柔地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“I can hear it, but I cannot see it, child.</p>
<p class="text-left">Someday the whole house will break to pieces and fall on top of us.</p>
<p class="text-left">If only Peter knew how to mend it!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why, grandmother, can’t you see the shutter?” asked Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Child, I cannot see anything,” said the old woman sadly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Can you see it when I open the shutter to let in the light?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No. Nobody can ever show me the light again.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“But you can see when you go out into the snow, where everything is bright.</p>
<p class="text-left">Come with me, grandmother!”</p>
<p class="text-left">and Heidi, taking the old woman by the hand, tried to lead her out.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Just let me stay here, child.</p>
<p class="text-left">Everything is dark for me, and my poor eyes can neither see the snow nor the light.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi burst out crying( 大哭起来 ) now and said aloud.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Can nobody make you see the light? Nobody?”</p>
<p class="text-left">It was awfully hard for Heidi to stop crying when she had once begun.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandmother said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Heidi, let me tell you something.</p>
<p class="text-left">People who cannot see love to listen to friendly words.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sit down beside me and tell me all about yourself.</p>
<p class="text-left">Talk to me about your grandfather, for it has been long since I have heard anything about him. I used to know him very well.”</p></div>

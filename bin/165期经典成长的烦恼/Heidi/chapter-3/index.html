                        <div><p class="text-left">Heidi arranged( 整理 ) her dresses tidily in a pile( 堆 ) and joined Peter and the goats( 山羊 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">When Peter saw her suddenly in her light clothes, he smiled.</p>
<p class="text-left">Looking back, he saw the little pile of dresses on the ground and then he smiled even more.</p>
<p class="text-left">The child, feeling free and comfortable, started to converse with Peter, and he had to answer many questions.</p>
<p class="text-left">She asked him how many goats he had, where he led them, what he did with them when he got there, and so forth( 等等 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">At last the children reached the mountain peak( 山顶 ) in front of the hut( 小屋 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">When Deta saw the little party of climbers, she cried out in a high voice:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Heidi, what have you done?</p>
<p class="text-left">Where are your dresses and your scarf, and your new shoes and new stockings( 袜子 )?”</p>
<p class="text-left">The child quietly pointed down and said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“There.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The aunt followed the direction of her finger and saw a little pile.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the middle of the pile was a small red dot( 圆点 ), which she recognized( 认出 ) as the scarf.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Unlucky child!” Deta said angrily.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What does all this mean? Why have you taken your things all off?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Because I do not need them,” said the child, who did not regret her deed( 行为 ) at all.</p>
<p class="text-left">“How can you be so stupid, Heidi? Have you lost your senses?”</p>
<p class="text-left">the aunt went on, with a mix of anger and blame( 责备 ) in her voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Who do you think will go way down there to fetch( 拿 ) those things up again?</p>
<p class="text-left">It is a half-hour walk.</p>
<p class="text-left">Please, Peter, run down and get them.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am late already,” replied Peter, with his hands in his trousers’ pockets.</p>
<p class="text-left">He stood without moving from the place where he had witnessed( 看见 ) the violent( 狂暴的 ) outbreak of Heidi’s aunt.</p>
<p class="text-left">“There you are, standing and staring( 盯 ), but that won’t get you further,” said Deta.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I’ll give you this if you go down.”</p>
<p class="text-left">With that she held a five-penny piece under his eyes.</p>
<p class="text-left">That made Peter start and in a great hurry he ran down the straightest path( 小路 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He arrived again in so short a time that Deta had to praise him and gave him her little coin without delay( 延迟 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He did not often get such a treasure, and therefore he happily dropped the money deep into his pocket.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If you are going up to the uncle, as we are, you can carry the pack( 包裹 ) till we get there,” said Deta.</p>
<p class="text-left">They still had to climb up the steep( 陡峭的 ) part of the mountain that lay behind Peter’s hut.</p>
<p class="text-left">The boy readily took the things and followed Deta.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi jumped along happily by his side with the goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">After three quarters of an hour, they reached the height where the hut of the old man stood on a big rock.</p>
<p class="text-left">The small house had no protection from the wind, but bathed( 沐浴 ) in the full sunlight.</p>
<p class="text-left">From there you could see far down into the valley( 山谷 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Behind the hut stood three old fir( 冷杉 ) trees with great branches( 树枝 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Further back the old gray rocks rose high.</p>
<p class="text-left">Above them you could see green grass, till at last nothing could grow on the stony rocks.</p>
<p class="text-left">By the side of the hut the uncle had made himself a bench( 长凳 ), from which one could look over the valley.</p>
<p class="text-left">Here he sat, with his pipe( 烟斗 ) between his teeth and both hands resting on his knees.</p>
<p class="text-left">He quietly watched the children climbing up with the goats and Aunt Deta behind them,</p>
<p class="text-left">for the children had caught up to her long ago.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi reached the top first.</p>
<p class="text-left">Approaching the old man, she held out her hand to him and said:</p>
<p class="text-left">“Good evening, grandfather!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Well, well, what does that mean?” replied the old man in a rough( 粗哑的 ) voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">Giving her his hand for only a moment, he watched her with a long and serious look from under his bushy( 浓密的 ) eyebrows( 眉毛 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi examined him with much curiosity( 好奇心 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He was strange to look at, with his thick, gray beard( 胡须 ) and long eyebrows.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi’s aunt had arrived with Peter, who was eager to see what was going to happen.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Good day to you, uncle,” said Deta as she approached.</p>
<p class="text-left">“This is Tobias and Adelheid’s child.</p>
<p class="text-left">You won’t be able to remember her, because last time you saw her she was only a year old.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why do you bring her here?” asked the uncle, and turning to Peter he said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Get away and bring my goats. How late you are already!”</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle looked at him angrily.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter obeyed( 听从 ) and disappeared on the spot( 立刻 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">“Uncle, I have brought the little girl for you to keep,” said Deta.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have done my share these last four years and now it is your turn to provide for her.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The old man’s eyes flamed( 发红 ) with anger.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Indeed!” he said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What on earth shall I do, when she begins to cry for you?</p>
<p class="text-left">Small children always do, and then I’ll be helpless.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You’ll have to look out for that!” Deta replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">“When the little baby was left in my hands a few years ago, I had to find out how to care for her myself.</p>
<p class="text-left">Nobody told me anything!</p>
<p class="text-left">You can’t blame me if I want to earn( 挣 ) some money now.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you can’t keep the child, you can do with her whatever you want.</p>
<p class="text-left">If she comes to harm, you are responsible( 负有责任的 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">And I am sure you do not want to feel worse than you already do.”</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">Mr. Carmichael paused a moment, as if a new thought had occurred to him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are you sure the child was left at a school in Paris?</p>
<p class="text-left">Are you sure it was Paris?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“My dear fellow,” said Carrisford, with restless impatience( 急躁 ), “I am sure of nothing.</p>
<p class="text-left">I never saw either the child or her mother.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ralph Crewe and I loved each other as boys, but we had not met since our school days, until we met in India.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was taken in by the grand promise of the mines.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was, too.</p>
<p class="text-left">The whole thing was so huge that we half lost our heads.</p>
<p class="text-left">When we met we hardly spoke of anything else.</p>
<p class="text-left">I only knew that the child had been sent to school somewhere.</p>
<p class="text-left">I do not even remember, now, how I knew it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The Indian gentleman moved forward and struck the table with a long, wasted hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Carmichael,” he said, “I must find her.</p>
<p class="text-left">If she is alive, she is somewhere.</p>
<p class="text-left">If she is alone and penniless, it is through my fault.</p>
<p class="text-left">How is a man to get back his health with a thing like that on his mind?</p>
<p class="text-left">This sudden change of luck at the mines has made realities of all our most fantastic dreams.</p>
<p class="text-left">But poor Crewe’s child may be begging in the street!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come, come,” said Carmichael.</p>
<p class="text-left">“We shall find her soon.</p>
<p class="text-left">We will continue to search for Madame Pascal’s good Russians.</p>
<p class="text-left">She seemed to think that they lived in Moscow.”</p>
<p class="text-left">On the other side of the wall, Sara was sitting in her attic talking to Melchisedec, who had come out for his evening meal.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It has been hard to be a princess today, Melchisedec,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It has been harder than usual. It gets harder as the weather grows colder and the streets get more wet.</p>
<p class="text-left">Lavinia laughed at my muddy( 污浊的 ) skirt as I passed her in the hall today.</p>
<p class="text-left">I thought of something to say all in a flash—and I only just stopped myself in time.</p>
<p class="text-left">You can’t talk back at people like that—if you are a princess.</p>
<p class="text-left">But you have to bite your tongue to hold yourself in.</p>
<p class="text-left">I bit mine. It was a cold afternoon, Melchisedec. And it’s a cold night.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Quite suddenly she put her black head down in her arms, as she often did when she was alone.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, papa,” she whispered, “what a long time it seems since I was your ‘Little Missus’!”</p>
<p class="text-left">This was what happened that day on both sides of the wall.</p>
<p class="text-left">The winter was an awful one.</p>
<p class="text-left">There were days on which Sara walked through snow when she went on her errands.</p>
<p class="text-left">There were worse days when the snow melted( 融化 ) and joined with mud( 泥 ) to form slush( 雪泥 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">On such days the windows of the house of the Large Family always looked very pleasant.</p>
<p class="text-left">The study in which the Indian gentleman sat was lit up with warmth.</p>
<p class="text-left">But the attic was dark and cheerless beyond words.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had many opportunities of proving to herself whether or not she was a princess.</p>
<p class="text-left">One of the strongest tests she was ever given came on a certain cold day.</p>
<p class="text-left">She would often think of it later, even in the years to come.</p>
<p class="text-left">For several days it had rained continuously; the streets were full of cold mist.</p>
<p class="text-left">Of course there were several long and tiring( 累人的 ) errands to be done.</p>
<p class="text-left">There always were hard tasks to be done on days like these. Sara was sent out again and again, until her old clothes were wet through.</p>
<p class="text-left">Added to this, she was not given any dinner, because Miss Minchin had chosen to punish her.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was so cold and hungry and tired that her face began to have a tense look.</p>
<p class="text-left">But she hurried on, trying to make her mind think of something else.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her way of doing it was to “pretend” and “suppose” with all the strength that was left in her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Suppose I had dry clothes on,” she thought, “suppose I had good shoes and a long, thick coat and a whole umbrella.</p>
<p class="text-left">And suppose—suppose—just when I was near a baker’s where they sold hot buns( 小圆面包 ), I should find sixpence—which belonged to nobody.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suppose if I did, I should go into the shop and buy six of the hottest buns and eat them all without stopping.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Some very strange things happen in this world sometimes.</p>
<p class="text-left">It certainly was a strange thing that happened to Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had to cross the street just when she was saying this to herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">The mud was deep—she almost had got stuck.</p>
<p class="text-left">She picked her way as carefully as she could, but she could not save herself much.</p>
<p class="text-left">In picking her way, she had to look down at her feet and the mud.</p>
<p class="text-left">In looking down—just as she reached the pavement—she saw something shining on the ground.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was actually a piece of silver—a tiny piece stepped on by many feet, but still with spirit enough left to shine a little.</p>
<p class="text-left">Not quite a sixpence, but the next thing to it—a fourpenny( 四便士 ) piece.</p></div>

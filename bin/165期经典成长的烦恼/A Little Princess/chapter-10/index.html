                        <div><p class="text-left">She sprang up.</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, she had got herself into deep trouble now!</p>
<p class="text-left">To have fallen asleep on such a young lady’s chair!</p>
<p class="text-left">She would be turned out of doors without her money.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, miss! Oh, miss!” she said nervously.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I ask your pardon, miss! Oh, I do, miss!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara jumped down, and came quite close to her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Don’t be frightened,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It doesn’t matter the least bit.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I didn’t go to do it, miss,” said Becky.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It was the warm fire—and I was so tired.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara broke into a friendly little laugh, and put her hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You were tired,” she said, “you could not help it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">How poor Becky stared at her!</p>
<p class="text-left">In fact, she had never heard such a friendly sound in anyone’s voice before.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was used to being ordered about and punished, and having her ears boxed.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Aren’t you angry, miss?” she asked fearfully.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Aren’t you going to tell the missus( 太太 )?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“No,” cried out Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Of course I’m not.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The fright( 惊吓 ) in the coal-stained face made her suddenly so sorry that she could hardly bear it.</p>
<p class="text-left">She put her hand against Becky’s cheek.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why,” she said, “we are just the same—I am only a little girl like you. It’s just an accident that I am not you, and you are not me!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky did not understand in the least.</p>
<p class="text-left">“An accident, miss,” she said. “Is it?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” Sara answered, and she looked at her for a moment like she was in a dream.</p>
<p class="text-left">But then she spoke in a different way.</p>
<p class="text-left">She realized that Becky did not know what she meant.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Have you done your work?” she asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Can you stay here a few minutes?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Here, miss? Me?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara ran to the door, opened it, and looked out and listened.</p>
<p class="text-left">“No one is anywhere about,” she explained.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Perhaps you might stay a tiny while.</p>
<p class="text-left">I thought—perhaps—you might like a piece of cake.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara gave her a thick piece of cake.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was happy when it was eaten in hungry bites.</p>
<p class="text-left">She talked and asked questions, and laughed until Becky’s fears actually began to calm themselves.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Becky,” she said, “weren’t you listening to that story?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, miss,” admitted Becky, a little alarmed again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I know I shouldn’t have, but it was so beautiful, I—I couldn’t help it.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I liked you to listen to it,” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Would you like to hear the rest?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Me hear it?” she cried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Like as if I was a pupil, miss!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara nodded.</p>
<p class="text-left">“You don’t have time to hear it now, I’m afraid,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But if you will tell me just what time you come to do my rooms, I will try to be here.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can tell you a bit of it every day until it is finished.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Then,” said Becky, “I wouldn’t mind how heavy the coal boxes were—or what the cook has done to me, if—if I might have that to think of.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You may,” said Sara. “I’ll tell it all to you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">When Becky went downstairs, she was not the same tired Becky who had come up.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had another piece of cake in her pocket, and she had been fed( 被喂饱 ) and warmed, but not only by cake and fire.</p>
<p class="text-left">Something else had warmed and fed her, and the something else was Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">Not very long after this a very exciting thing happened.</p>
<p class="text-left">Not only Sara, but the entire school, found it exciting, and talked about it for weeks.</p>
<p class="text-left">In one of his letters, Captain Crewe told a most interesting story.</p>
<p class="text-left">A friend who had been at school with him had unexpectedly come to see him in India.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was the owner of a large piece of land upon which diamonds had been found, and he was involved in developing the mines.</p>
<p class="text-left">If all went as was expected, he would have so much wealth that it made one dizzy( 晕眩的 ) to think of.</p>
<p class="text-left">Because he was fond of Captain Crewe, the school friend had given him an opportunity to share in this huge fortune by becoming a partner in his plan.</p>
<p class="text-left">This, at least, was what Sara understood from his letters.</p>
<p class="text-left">It is true that any other business plan, however grand, would have had small attraction for her or for the classroom.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Diamond mines,” however, sounded so like the Arabian Nights( 天方夜谭 ) that everyone was interested.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara painted pictures, for Ermengarde and Lottie, of passages deep in the earth, where shining stones lined the walls and roofs, and men dug them out with picks.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ermengarde delighted in the story, and Lottie insisted on its being retold to her every evening.</p>
<p class="text-left">Lavinia was very mean about it, and told Jessie that she didn’t believe such things as diamond mines existed.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I believe you hate her,” said Jessie.</p>
<p class="text-left">“No, I don’t,” said Lavinia quickly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But I don’t believe in mines full of diamonds.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Well, people have to get them from somewhere.</p>
<p class="text-left">If she does, she’ll be as rich as the royal family.” said Jessie.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, Lavinia,” with a new little laugh, “I heard that one of Sara’s ‘pretends’ is that she is a princess.</p>
<p class="text-left">She plays it all the time—even in school.</p>
<p class="text-left">She says it makes her learn her lessons better.</p>
<p class="text-left">She wants Ermengarde to be one, too, but Ermengarde says she is too fat.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is too fat,” said Lavinia, “and Sara is too thin.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Naturally, Jessie laughed again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She says it has nothing to do with what you look like, or what you have.</p>
<p class="text-left">It has only to do with what you think of, and what you do.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I suppose she thinks she could be a princess if she was a beggar,” said Lavinia.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Let us begin to call her Your Royal Highness( 殿下 ).”</p></div>

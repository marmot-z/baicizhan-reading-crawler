                        <div><p class="text-left">“I think we might eat something first,” said the grandfather.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Don’t you think so?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi had forgotten everything else in her interest for the bed;</p>
<p class="text-left">but when she was reminded( 被提醒 ) of her dinner, she noticed how terribly hungry she really was.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi said happily,</p>
<p class="text-left">“I think we might, grandfather!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Let’s go down then, if we agree,” said the old man, and followed close behind her.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the kettle( 壶 ) was boiling( 煮沸 ), the old man put a large piece of cheese( 奶酪 ) on a long iron fork.</p>
<p class="text-left">He held it over the fire, turning it till it was golden-brown on all sides.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi had watched him eagerly( 急切地 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly she ran to the cupboard( 橱柜 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Grandfather brought a pot( 盆 ) and the toasted( 烤的 ) cheese to the table.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi had already set it with two plates( 盘子 ) and two knives and the bread in the middle.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi had seen the things in the cupboard and knew that they would be needed for the meal.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am glad to see that you can think for yourself,” said the grandfather,</p>
<p class="text-left">and he put the cheese on top of the bread.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi had never enjoyed her dinner more.</p>
<p class="text-left">After they finished, the night came.</p>
<p class="text-left">The old fir( 冷杉 ) trees were moving and a mighty wind was blowing loudly through the tree-tops.</p>
<p class="text-left">Suddenly a high whistle( 哨声 ) was heard.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi ran outside and the grandfather joined her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Down from the heights came one goat( 山羊 ) after another, with Peter in their middle.</p>
<p class="text-left">When they had all reached the hut( 小屋 ), they stopped on their way</p>
<p class="text-left">and two beautiful thin goats separated themselves from the group.</p>
<p class="text-left">One of them was white and the other was brown.</p>
<p class="text-left">They came up to the grandfather, who held out some salt in his hands to them, as he did every night.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi tenderly( 温柔地 ) touched the first one and then the other.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are they ours, grandfather?</p>
<p class="text-left">Do they both belong to( 属于 ) us?</p>
<p class="text-left">Are they going to the shed( 棚 ) over there?</p>
<p class="text-left">Are they going to stay with us?” Heidi kept on asking in her excitement.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather hardly could put in a “yes, yes, surely” between her many questions.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the goats had eaten up all the salt, the old man said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Go in, Heidi, and fetch( 拿 ) your bowl( 碗 ) and the bread.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi obeyed( 听从 ) and returned instantly( 立即 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather milked a full bowl from the white goat, cut a piece of bread for the child, and told her to eat.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Afterwards( 然后 ) you can go to bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you need some shirts and other clothes, you will find them in the bottom of the cupboard.</p>
<p class="text-left">Aunt Deta has left a bundle( 一包 ) for you.</p>
<p class="text-left">Now good night, I have to look after the goats and lock them up for the night.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Good night, grandfather! Oh, please tell me what their names are,” called Heidi after him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The white one’s name is Schwänli and the brown one I call Bärli,” was his answer.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Good night, Schwänli! Good night, Bärli,” the little girl called loudly.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi now sat down on the bench( 长凳 ) and took her supper( 晚餐 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The strong wind nearly blew her from her seat, so she hurried with her meal.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then she went inside and up to her bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Very soon after Heidi had gone up, before it was quite dark, the old man also sought his bed( 就寝 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a wild, stormy night;</p>
<p class="text-left">the hut was shaking and all the boards were creaking( 嘎吱作响 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">In the middle of the night the grandfather got up, saying to himself:</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am sure she is afraid.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Climbing up the ladder( 梯子 ), he went up to Heidi’s bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her cheeks( 脸颊 ) were burning red and she lay peacefully on her round arms.</p>
<p class="text-left">She must have had a happy dream, for she was smiling in her sleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather stood and watched her till a cloud flew over the moon and left everything in total darkness.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he went down to seek his bed again.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was awakened early next morning by a loud whistle.</p>
<p class="text-left">Opening her eyes, she saw her little bed and the hay( 干草 ) bathed( 沐浴 ) in golden sunlight.</p>
<p class="text-left">Jumping out of bed, she went down the ladder and ran outside.</p>
<p class="text-left">Peter was already there with his goats, waiting for Schwänli and Bärli,</p>
<p class="text-left">whom the grandfather was just bringing to join the other goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you want to go with him to the pasture( 牧场 )?” asked the grandfather.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” cried Heidi, clapping( 拍手 ) her hands.</p>
<p class="text-left">Before they went, the grandfather put into Peter’s bag a piece of bread and some cheese.</p>
<p class="text-left">They were easily twice as large as those the boy had in the bag himself.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The little bowl goes in, too,” said the Uncle.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The child does not know how to drink straight from the goat.</p>
<p class="text-left">She is going to stay with you all day; therefore milk two bowls full for her lunch.</p>
<p class="text-left">Look out that she does not fall over the rocks!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi and Peter started merrily( 兴高采烈地 ) up the Alp.</p>
<p class="text-left">A cloudless, deep blue sky looked down on them, for the wind had driven away every little cloud in the night.</p>
<p class="text-left">The fresh green mountainside( 山坡 ) was bathed in brilliant( 灿烂的 ) sunlight.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi was wild with joy( 欢乐 ) and ran from side to side.</p>
<p class="text-left">She saw beautiful red, blue, and golden flowers everywhere between the green grass.</p>
<p class="text-left">In her pleasure at finding such treasures, Heidi even forgot Peter and his goats.</p>
<p class="text-left">She ran far ahead of him and then walked away off to one side, for the bright flowers brought her here and there.</p>
<p class="text-left">Picking a lot of them to take home with her, she put them all into her little apron( 围裙 ).</p></div>

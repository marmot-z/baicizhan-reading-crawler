                        <div><p class="text-left">He had made wonderful preparations for her birthday.</p>
<p class="text-left">Among other things, a new doll had been ordered in Paris, and her wardrobe was to be beautiful.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she had replied to the letter that asked her if the doll would be an acceptable present, Sara had been very thoughtful.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am getting very old,” she wrote, “I shall never have another doll given me.</p>
<p class="text-left">This will be my last doll.</p>
<p class="text-left">No one could ever take Emily’s place, but I should respect the Last Doll very much.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Captain Crewe had a terrible headache when he read this letter in his house in India.</p>
<p class="text-left">The table before him was covered with papers and letters.</p>
<p class="text-left">They worried him and filled him with fear, but he laughed as he had not laughed for weeks.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh,” he said, “I would give anything to have her little arms round my neck this minute! Anything!”</p>
<p class="text-left">When Sara entered the holly-hung classroom in the afternoon of her birthday, Miss Minchin, in her most expensive silk dress, led her by the hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">A servant followed, carrying the box containing( 装有 ) the Last Doll.</p>
<p class="text-left">A housemaid( 女仆 ) carried a second box, and Becky was behind them, carrying a third box and wearing a clean dress.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara felt shy when, on her entry, the big girls stared at her, and the little ones began to turn happily in their seats.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Silence, young ladies!” said Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“James, place the box on the table and remove the lid( 盖子 ). Emma, put yours upon a chair. Becky! You may leave us.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin turned away the servants with a wave of her hand.</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky stepped aside respectfully to allow the higher servants to pass out first.</p>
<p class="text-left">She could not help casting a longing glance at the box on the table.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If you please, Miss Minchin,” said Sara, suddenly, “may Becky stay?”</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a brave thing to do.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I know she will like to see the presents,” she explained.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is a little girl, too, you know.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin was displeased.</p>
<p class="text-left">“My dear Sara,” she said, “Becky is the scullery maid. Scullery maids are not little girls.”</p>
<p class="text-left">To Miss Minchin, scullery maids were machines who carried coal and made fires.</p>
<p class="text-left">“But Becky is,” said Sara. “Please let her stay—because it is my birthday.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin replied seriously:</p>
<p class="text-left">“As you ask it as a birthday favor—she may stay.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Rebecca, go and stand there,” she said. “Not too near the young ladies.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky went to her place, smiling widely.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not care where she was sent, as long as she might have the luck of being inside the room.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now, young ladies, I have a few words to say to you,” Miss Minchin announced.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She’s going to make a speech,” whispered one of the girls. “I wish it was over.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You are aware, young ladies,” the speech began—for it was a speech—“that dear Sara is eleven years old today.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Several of you here have also been eleven years old, but Sara’s birthdays are rather different from other little girls’ birthdays.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she is older she will be heiress( 女继承人 ) to a large fortune, which it will be her duty to spend in a generous manner.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara has become my most skilled pupil.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her French and her dancing are a credit to( 为...增光的人或物 ) the school.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her manners—which have caused you to call her Princess Sara—are perfect.</p>
<p class="text-left">She shows her goodness by giving you this afternoon’s party.</p>
<p class="text-left">I hope you appreciate her generosity.</p>
<p class="text-left">I wish you to express your appreciation of it by saying aloud all together, ‘Thank you, Sara!’ ”</p>
<p class="text-left">The entire classroom rose to its feet.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Thank you, Sara!” it said.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara looked rather shy for a moment.</p>
<p class="text-left">She gave a nod in return.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Thank you,” she said, “for coming to my party.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Very pretty, indeed, Sara,” said Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Now I will leave you to enjoy yourselves.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The instant she had left the room, the spell her presence always had upon them was broken.</p>
<p class="text-left">The door had hardly closed before every seat was empty.</p>
<p class="text-left">All the girls rushed toward the boxes.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara bent over the biggest box with a delighted face.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she took out the Last Doll, it was so beautiful that the children made delighted sounds of joy.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is almost as big as Lottie,” someone said with surprise.</p>
<p class="text-left">Lottie clapped her hands and danced about, laughing.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Here is her trunk( 行李箱 ),” said Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Let us open it and look at her things.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She sat down upon the floor and turned the key.</p>
<p class="text-left">There were lace collars and silk stockings.</p>
<p class="text-left">There was a jewel( 珠宝 ) case with a necklace which looked quite as if it was made of real diamonds.</p>
<p class="text-left">Even Lavinia and Jessie forgot that they were too elderly to care for dolls, and expressed their delight.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Suppose,” Sara said, as she stood by the table—“suppose she understands human talk and feels proud of being admired.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“You are always supposing things,” said Lavinia unkindly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I know I am,” answered Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I like it. There is nothing so nice as supposing. If you suppose anything hard enough, it seems as if it were real.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s all very well to suppose things if you have everything,” said Lavinia.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Could you suppose and pretend if you were a beggar?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara looked thoughtful.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I believe I could,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If one was a beggar, one would have to suppose and pretend all the time. But it mightn’t be easy.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She often thought later how strange it was that just as she had finished saying this—just at that very moment—Miss Amelia came into the room.</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">It was several weeks before they found out that the new occupant( 住户 ) had neither wife nor children.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was a single man with no family at all, and it was evident that he was unwell in body and unhappy in mind.</p>
<p class="text-left">A carriage drove up one day and stopped before the house.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the footman( 男仆 ) came down from the box and opened the door, the gentleman who was the father of the Large Family got out first.</p>
<p class="text-left">After him there came a nurse and two men-servants.</p>
<p class="text-left">They came to help their master out of the carriage.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was a man with a tired, unhappy face, and a thin body covered in furs.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was carried up the steps, and the head of the Large Family went with him, looking very anxious.</p>
<p class="text-left">Soon a doctor’s carriage arrived, and the doctor went in—plainly to take care of him.</p>
<p class="text-left">That was the beginning of the story of the Indian gentleman.</p>
<p class="text-left">There were fine sunsets even in the square, sometimes.</p>
<p class="text-left">One could only see parts of them, however, between the chimneys and over the roofs.</p>
<p class="text-left">From the kitchen windows one could not see them at all, and could only guess that they were going on.</p>
<p class="text-left">There was, however, one place from which one could see all the beauty of them: the attic window.</p>
<p class="text-left">The square would suddenly seem to light up in a magical way and look wonderful despite its dirty trees and houses.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she would see this, Sara knew something was going on in the sky.</p>
<p class="text-left">When it was possible to leave the kitchen without being missed or called back, she would steal away and go up the flights of stairs.</p>
<p class="text-left">She would climb on the old table, and get her head and body as far out of the window as possible.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she had done this, she always drew a long breath and looked all round her.</p>
<p class="text-left">It used to seem as if she had all the sky and the world to herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">There was a beautiful sunset a few days after the Indian gentleman was brought to his new home.</p>
<p class="text-left">She climbed on her table and stood looking out.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a wonderful moment.</p>
<p class="text-left">There were floods of shining gold covering the western sky, as if a glorious tide( 潮汐 ) was sweeping over the world.</p>
<p class="text-left">A deep, rich yellow light filled the air; the birds flying across the tops of the houses looked quite black as they flew in front of the shining light.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s a beautiful one,” said Sara, softly, to herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It makes me feel almost afraid—as if something strange was just going to happen.</p>
<p class="text-left">The beautiful ones always make me feel like that.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She suddenly turned her head because she heard a sound a few yards away from her.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a strange sound like a little high voice. It came from the window of the next attic.</p>
<p class="text-left">Someone had come to look at the sunset as she had.</p>
<p class="text-left">There was a head and a part of a body sticking out from the skylight( 天窗 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">It was not the head or body of a little girl or a housemaid.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was the dark-faced, bright-eyed, white-turbaned head of a native Indian man-servant.</p>
<p class="text-left">“A Lascar,” Sara said to herself quickly—and the sound she had heard came from a small monkey which was curled up( 蜷缩 ) in his arms and making noises against his breast.</p>
<p class="text-left">As Sara looked toward him he looked toward her.</p>
<p class="text-left">The first thing she thought was that his dark face looked sad and homesick.</p>
<p class="text-left">She felt sure that he had come up to look at the sun.</p>
<p class="text-left">He had seen it so seldom in England that he must have longed for a sight of it.</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked at him with interest for a second, and then smiled across the roof.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had learned to know how comforting a smile, even from a stranger, may be.</p>
<p class="text-left">Hers was evidently a pleasure to him.</p>
<p class="text-left">His whole expression changed.</p>
<p class="text-left">He showed such bright white teeth as he smiled back that it was as if a light had been turned on in his dark face.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was perhaps in seeing her that he lost his hold on the monkey.</p>
<p class="text-left">He was a restless monkey and always ready for adventure, and it is probable that the sight of a little girl excited him.</p>
<p class="text-left">He suddenly jumped on to the roof, ran across it, and went onto Sara’s shoulder, and from there down into her attic room.</p>
<p class="text-left">It made her laugh and delighted her, but she knew he must be given back to his master.</p>
<p class="text-left">She wondered how this was to be done.</p>
<p class="text-left">Would he let her catch him?</p>
<p class="text-left">Or would he refuse to be caught, and perhaps get away and run off over the roofs and be lost?</p>
<p class="text-left">That would not do at all.</p>
<p class="text-left">She turned to the Lascar, feeling glad that she remembered still some of the Hindustani( 印度斯坦语 ) she had learned when she lived with her father.</p>
<p class="text-left">She could make the man understand.</p>
<p class="text-left">She spoke to him in the language he knew.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Will he let me catch him?” she asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">She thought she had never seen more surprise and happiness than the dark face expressed when she spoke in the language he knew.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The monkey was a good monkey and would not bite,” the man replied, “but, unfortunately, he was difficult to catch.”</p>
<p class="text-left">If Sara would allow Ram Dass, for that was the man’s name, to cross the roof to her room, and enter the windows, he could take the little animal back.</p>
<p class="text-left">But he was evidently afraid Sara might think he was being disrespectful( 失礼的 ) and perhaps would not let him come.</p>
<p class="text-left">But Sara gave him leave at once.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Can you get across?” she asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“In a moment,” he answered her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Then come,” she said; “he is flying from side to side of the room as if he was frightened.”</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">Deta had said in a higher voice than she had wanted, just because her conscience( 良知 ) was not quite clear.</p>
<p class="text-left">The uncle had risen during her last words and now he gave her such a look that she stepped back a little.</p>
<p class="text-left">Holding out his arm in a commanding( 指挥的 ) gesture( 手势 ), he said to her,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Away with you! Stay wherever you came from and don’t come back again!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Deta did not have to be told twice.</p>
<p class="text-left">She said “Goodbye” to Heidi and “Farewell( 再见 )” to the uncle, and started down the mountain.</p>
<p class="text-left">She ran down very quickly as if she were driven by steam( 蒸汽 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">On her way downward( 向下的 ), people called to her more because they wondered where she had left the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">Deta ran as quickly as she could and was glad when she heard no more calls.</p>
<p class="text-left">But, to tell the truth, Deta was uneasy.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her mother had asked her to care for Heidi when she died.</p>
<p class="text-left">But she eased herself with the thought that she would be able to do more for the child if she could earn( 挣 ) some money.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was very glad to go away from people who wanted to involve themselves in her affairs( 事务 ),</p>
<p class="text-left">and she looked forward with great delight( 高兴 ) to her new place.</p>
<p class="text-left">After Deta had disappeared, the Uncle sat down again on the bench( 长凳 ), blowing big clouds of smoke out of his pipe( 烟斗 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">He did not speak, but kept his eyes fastened on( 集中注意力于... ) the ground.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi looked about her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Discovering( 发现 ) the small shed( 棚 ) where the goats lived, she walked in.</p>
<p class="text-left">Nothing could be seen inside.</p>
<p class="text-left">Searching for something more interesting, she saw the three old fir( 冷杉 ) trees behind the hut.</p>
<p class="text-left">Here the wind was blowing loudly through the branches( 树枝 ) and the tree-tops were moving from one side to another.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi stood still to listen.</p>
<p class="text-left">After the wind had become less strong, she walked around the hut back to her grandfather.</p>
<p class="text-left">She found him in exactly the same position.</p>
<p class="text-left">She planted herself in front of the old man and looked at him, with arms folded( 交叠 ) behind her back.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather, looking up, saw the child standing still before him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What do you want to do now?” he asked her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I want to see what’s in the hut,” replied Heidi.</p>
<p class="text-left">“All right, you can; but fetch( 拿 ) the things and we’ll put them in the cupboard( 橱柜 ).” The child obeyed( 服从 ) the command.</p>
<p class="text-left">The old man now opened the door, and Heidi followed him into a fairly spacious( 宽敞的 ) room.</p>
<p class="text-left">In one corner stood a table and a chair, and in another the grandfather’s bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Across the room a large kettle( 壶 ) hung over the fire.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather opened the cupboard, in which all his clothes were kept.</p>
<p class="text-left">In one shelf( 架子 ) were a few shirts, socks and towels( 毛巾 );</p>
<p class="text-left">on another a few plates( 盘子 ), cups and glasses;</p>
<p class="text-left">and on the top shelf Heidi could see a round loaf of( 一条 ) bread, some bacon( 熏肉 ) and cheese( 奶酪 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi pushed her things as far behind the grandfather’s clothes as she could reach.</p>
<p class="text-left">She did not want them found again in a hurry.</p>
<p class="text-left">After looking around in the room, she asked,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Where am I going to sleep, grandfather?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Wherever you want to,” he replied.</p>
<p class="text-left">That suited( 合...的心意 ) Heidi exactly.</p>
<p class="text-left">She looked into all the corners of the room and looked at every little space to find a nice place to sleep.</p>
<p class="text-left">Beside the old man’s bed she saw a ladder( 梯子 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Climbing up, she arrived at a place which was filled with fresh and fragrant( 芳香的 ) hay( 干草 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Through a tiny round window, she could look far down into the valley.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I want to sleep up here,” Heidi called down.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, it is lovely here. Please come up, grandfather, and see it for yourself.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I know it,” the grandfather’s voice came from below.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am making the bed now,” the little girl called out again, while she ran busily to and fro.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh, do come up and bring a sheet( 床单 ), grandfather, for every bed must have a sheet.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Is that so?” said the old man.</p>
<p class="text-left">After a while he opened the cupboard and looked around in it.</p>
<p class="text-left">At last he pulled out a long rough( 粗糙的 ) cloth( 布 ) from under the shirts.</p>
<p class="text-left">It somewhat looked like a sheet, and with this he climbed up to the loft( 阁楼 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">Here a tidy little bed was already prepared.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi looked thoughtfully at her fresh, new bed and said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“Grandfather, we have forgotten something.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“What?” he asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I have no cover.</p>
<p class="text-left">When I go to bed, I always sleep between the sheet and the cover.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“What shall we do if I don’t have any?” asked the grandfather.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Never mind, I’ll just take some more hay to cover me,” Heidi told him.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was just going to the pile( 堆 ) of hay when the old man stopped her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Just wait one minute,” he said, and went down to his own bed.</p>
<p class="text-left">From it he took a large, heavy bag and brought it to the child.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Isn’t this better than hay?” he asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">Heidi pulled the bag to and fro with all her might, but it was too heavy for her to unfold( 展开 ) it.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grandfather put the thick cover on the bed while Heidi watched him.</p>
<p class="text-left">After it was all done, she said,</p>
<p class="text-left">“What a nice bed I have now!</p>
<p class="text-left">I only wish the night was here, so that I might go to sleep in it.”</p></div>

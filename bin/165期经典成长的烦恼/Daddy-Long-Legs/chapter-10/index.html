                        <div><p class="text-left">Friday, 9.30 p.m.</p>
<p class="text-left">Such a lot of troubles!</p>
<p class="text-left">I didn’t hear the rising bell this morning.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then I broke my shoe-lace while I was hurrying to dress.</p>
<p class="text-left">I was late for breakfast and also for first period.</p>
<p class="text-left">I had a disagreement with my mathematics professor( 教授 ) about logarithms( 对数 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">On looking it up, I find that she was right.</p>
<p class="text-left">We had mutton( 羊肉 ) for lunch, which I hate—it tastes of the John Grier Home.</p>
<p class="text-left">The mail( 邮件 ) brought me nothing but bills (obviously my family don’t write).</p>
<p class="text-left">But this didn’t end the day.</p>
<p class="text-left">There was worse to come.</p>
<p class="text-left">It rained so we couldn’t play golf( 高尔夫 ), but had to go to the gymnasium( 体育馆 ) instead.</p>
<p class="text-left">The girl next to me hit my elbow( 手肘 ) with an exercise club.</p>
<p class="text-left">I got home to find that the box with my new blue spring dress had come, and the skirt was so tight( 紧的 ) that I couldn’t sit down.</p>
<p class="text-left">Friday is cleaning day, and the cleaning lady had mixed up all the papers on my desk.</p>
<p class="text-left">We were kept in chapel( 小教堂 ) twenty minutes later than usual to listen to a speech about womanly women.</p>
<p class="text-left">And then—just as I was sitting down with The Portrait of a Lady( 一位贵妇的画像，书名 ), in came a very stupid girl named Ackerly.</p>
<p class="text-left">She sits next to me in Latin( 拉丁语 ) class, because her name begins with A. (I wish Mrs. Lippett had named me Zabriski.)</p>
<p class="text-left">She came to ask if Monday’s lesson begins at paragraph( 段落 ) 69 or 70, and stayed for ONE HOUR.</p>
<p class="text-left">She has just gone.</p>
<p class="text-left">Did you ever hear of such a discouraging( 令人沮丧的 ) series of events?</p>
<p class="text-left">It isn’t the big troubles in life that require strength of character. Anybody can rise to a crisis( 危机 ) and face a tragedy( 悲剧 ) with courage.</p>
<p class="text-left">But to meet the small difficulties of the day with a laugh—I really think that requires spirit.</p>
<p class="text-left">It’s the kind of character that I am going to develop. I am going to pretend( 假装 ) that all life is just a game which I must play as skillfully and fairly as I can.</p>
<p class="text-left">If I lose, I am going to shrug( 耸肩 ) my shoulders and laugh—also if I win.</p>
<p class="text-left">Anyway, I am going to be a good sport.</p>
<p class="text-left">You will never hear me complain( 抱怨 ) again, Daddy dear, because Julia wears silk stockings( 长袜 ) and centipedes( 蜈蚣 ) drop off the wall.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy</p>
<p class="text-left">Answer soon.</p>
<p class="text-left">May 27th</p>
<p class="text-left">Daddy-Long-Legs, Esq.</p>
<p class="text-left">DEAR SIR: I have just received a letter from Mrs. Lippett.</p>
<p class="text-left">She hopes that I am behaving well( 行为规矩 ), and doing well in my studies. I probably have no place to go this summer.</p>
<p class="text-left">So she will let me come back to the Home and work for my food and accommodation( 住宿 ) until college opens.</p>
<p class="text-left">I HATE THE JOHN GRIER HOME.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’d rather die than go back.</p>
<p class="text-left">Yours most truthfully,</p>
<p class="text-left">Jerusha Abbott</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">You are wonderful! I am very happy about the farm, because I have never been on a farm in my life.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’d hate to return to John Grier and wash dishes all summer.</p>
<p class="text-left">There would be a danger of something terrible happening.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have lost the humble( 谦逊的 ) attitude I had before, and I am afraid that I would just go wild and smash( 打碎 ) everything.</p>
<p class="text-left">Forgive the shortness of this letter, and the paper.</p>
<p class="text-left">I can’t tell you my latest news, because I am in French class, and I’m afraid the teacher is going to call on me.</p>
<p class="text-left">He did!</p>
<p class="text-left">Goodbye, I love you very much,</p>
<p class="text-left">Judy.</p>
<p class="text-left">May 30th</p>
<p class="text-left">Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,</p>
<p class="text-left">Did you ever see the campus( 校园 )?</p>
<p class="text-left">It is so beautiful in May.</p>
<p class="text-left">All the flowers have opened, and the trees are the loveliest young green.</p>
<p class="text-left">The grass is dotted with( 星星点点布满 ) yellow dandelions( 蒲公英 ) and hundreds of girls in blue and white and pink dresses.</p>
<p class="text-left">Everybody is happy and carefree( 无忧无虑的 ), for vacation’s coming.</p>
<p class="text-left">With that to look forward to, examinations don’t count.</p>
<p class="text-left">Isn’t that a happy state of mind to be in?</p>
<p class="text-left">And oh, Daddy! I’m the happiest of all!</p>
<p class="text-left">Because I’m not in the Home any more.</p>
<p class="text-left">And I’m not anybody’s nursemaid( 保姆 ) or typist( 打字员 ) or bookkeeper( 簿记员 ). (I should have been, you know, without your help.)</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m sorry now for everything I did wrong.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m sorry I was ever rude( 无礼的 ) to Mrs. Lippett.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m sorry I ever filled the sugar bowl with salt.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m sorry I ever made faces behind the Trustees( 董事 )’ backs.</p>
<p class="text-left">I’m going to be good and sweet and kind to everybody because I’m so happy.</p>
<p class="text-left">And this summer I’m going to write and write and write and begin to be a great author.</p>
<p class="text-left">Isn’t that a noble( 崇高的 ) plan to make?</p>
<p class="text-left">Oh, I’m developing a beautiful character!</p>
<p class="text-left">It suffers( 受苦 ) a bit under cold and frost( 霜 ), but it grows fast when the sun shines.</p>
<p class="text-left">That’s the way with everybody.</p>
<p class="text-left">I don’t agree with the theory that sorrow( 悲伤 ) and disappointment( 失望 ) develop moral strength.</p>
<p class="text-left">The happy people are the ones who are overflowing( 充满 ) with kindness.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have no sympathy( 同情心 ) for misanthropes( 厌恶人类的人 ). (Fine word! Just learned it.)</p>
<p class="text-left">You’re not one of them, are you, Daddy?</p></div>

                        <div><p class="text-left">The Magic had been there again.</p>
<p class="text-left">It really had, and it had done even more than before.</p>
<p class="text-left">The fire was shining, more than ever.</p>
<p class="text-left">A number of new things had been brought into the attic.</p>
<p class="text-left">Upon the low table, another supper stood—this time with cups and plates for Becky as well as herself.</p>
<p class="text-left">All the ugly things which could be covered with cloth had been hidden and made to look quite pretty.</p>
<p class="text-left">Some materials of rich colors had been hung up on the wall with little nails.</p>
<p class="text-left">Some bright fans were pinned up, and there were several pillows, big enough to use as seats.</p>
<p class="text-left">A wooden box was covered with a carpet, and some pillows lay on it, so that it looked like a sofa.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara slowly sat down and looked and looked again.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is exactly like something fairy come true,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“And to think I used to pretend and pretend and wish there were fairies( 精灵 )!</p>
<p class="text-left">The one thing I always wanted was to see a fairy story come true.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am living in a fairy story.”</p>
<p class="text-left">From that time life became more wonderful day by day.</p>
<p class="text-left">The fairy story continued.</p>
<p class="text-left">Almost every day something new was done.</p>
<p class="text-left">Some new comfort appeared each time Sara opened the door at night, until the attic was a beautiful little room.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Sara went downstairs in the morning, the remains of the supper were on the table.</p>
<p class="text-left">When she returned to the attic in the evening, the magician had taken them away and left another nice little meal.</p>
<p class="text-left">The comfort and happiness she enjoyed were making her stronger.</p>
<p class="text-left">If she came home from her errands tired and hungry, she knew she would soon be warm and well fed.</p>
<p class="text-left">In a very short time she began to look less thin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Sara Crewe looks wonderfully well,” Miss Minchin said with annoyance to her sister.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” answered Miss Amelia.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is absolutely fattening. Before she looked like a little starved( 挨饿的 ) bird.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Starved!” cried Miss Minchin, angrily.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Why should she look starved? She always had plenty to eat!”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Of—of course,” agreed Miss Amelia, believing that she had, as usual, said the wrong thing.</p>
<p class="text-left">Even Becky was beginning to look more healthy and less frightened.</p>
<p class="text-left">She could not help it. She had her share in the secret fairy story, too.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Bastille had disappeared, the prisoners no longer existed.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then another wonderful thing happened.</p>
<p class="text-left">A man came to the door and left several parcels.</p>
<p class="text-left">All were addressed, “To the Little Girl in the right-hand attic.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara herself was sent to open the door and take them in.</p>
<p class="text-left">She laid the two largest parcels on the hall table, and was looking at the address.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin came down the stairs and saw her.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Take the things to the young lady to whom they belong,” she said strictly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Don’t stand there looking at them.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“They belong to me,” answered Sara, quietly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“To you?” asked Miss Minchin.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t know where they come from,” said Sara, “but they are addressed to me. I sleep in the right-hand attic. Becky has the other one.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“What is in them?” Miss Minchin demanded.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I don’t know,” replied Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Open them,” she ordered.</p>
<p class="text-left">Sara did as she was told.</p>
<p class="text-left">When the packages were unfolded, Miss Minchin saw pretty and comfortable clothing of different kinds: shoes, stockings, and gloves, and a warm and beautiful coat.</p>
<p class="text-left">Miss Minchin was quite upset.</p>
<p class="text-left">Could it be that she had made a mistake, after all?</p>
<p class="text-left">Could the poor child have some previously unknown relation, who had suddenly found her, and chose to provide for her in this strange way?</p>
<p class="text-left">She felt very uncertain, and she gave a side look at Sara.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Well,” she said, in a voice which she had never used since the little girl lost her father, “someone is very kind to you.</p>
<p class="text-left">As the things have been sent, you may as well go and put them on and look respectable.</p>
<p class="text-left">After you are dressed you may come downstairs and learn your lessons in the classroom.</p>
<p class="text-left">You need not go out on any more errands today.”</p>
<p class="text-left">About half an hour later, when the classroom door opened and Sara walked in, the entire school was silent.</p>
<p class="text-left">“My word!” cried Jessie, to Lavinia.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Look at the Princess Sara!”</p>
<p class="text-left">Everybody was looking, and when Lavinia looked she turned quite red.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was the Princess Sara indeed.</p>
<p class="text-left">At least, since the days when she had been a princess, Sara had never looked as she did now.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was dressed in the kind of dress Lavinia had wanted.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Perhaps the diamond mines have suddenly appeared again,” said Lavinia, unkindly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Sara,” broke in Miss Minchin’s deep voice, “come and sit here.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And while the whole classroom looked, and hardly made any effort to hide its excited curiosity, Sara went to her old seat, and started reading.</p>
<p class="text-left">That night, when she went to her room, she and Becky eat their supper.</p>
<p class="text-left">She sat and looked at the fire seriously for a long time.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are you making something up in your head, miss?” Becky asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">When Sara sat in silence and looked into the coals with dreaming eyes, it generally meant that she was making a new story.</p>
<p class="text-left">But this time she was not, and she shook her head.</p>
<p class="text-left">“No,” she answered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I am wondering what I ought to do.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“I can’t help thinking about my friend,” Sara explained.</p>
<p class="text-left">“If he wants to keep himself a secret, it would be rude to try and find out who he is.</p>
<p class="text-left">But I do so want him to know how thankful I am to him—and how happy he has made me.</p>
<p class="text-left">I wish—I do wish—”</p>
<p class="text-left">Her eyes at that instant fell upon something standing on a table in a corner.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a little writing-case fitted with paper and envelopes and pens and ink.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Oh,” she said, “why did I not think of that before?”</p></div>

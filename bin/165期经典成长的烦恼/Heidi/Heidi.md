Heidi

The little old town of Mayenfeld is beautifully situated.

A footpath leads to the foot of the heights, which look down upon the valley( 山谷 ).

One bright sunny morning in June, a tall, strong woman climbed up the path( 小路 ), leading a little girl by the hand.

The youngster’s cheeks( 脸颊 ) were in such a glow( 脸上的红光 ) that it showed even through her sun-browned skin.

Despite the heat, the five-year-old was dressed as if she had to brave a cold winter.

Her shape was difficult to see, for she wore two dresses, perhaps three, and a large red cotton( 棉布 ) scarf around her shoulders.

Wearing heavy boots( 靴子 ), this hot and shapeless( 没形状的 ) little person worked hard to get up the mountain.

The pair had been climbing for about an hour when they reached a village halfway up the great mountain named the Alm.

It was the elder girl’s hometown, and therefore she was greeted( 收到问候 ) from nearly every hut( 小屋 );

people called to her from windows and doors, and very often from the road.

But the girl did not hang around on her way and only stood still when she reached the end of the village.

There stood a few cottages( 乡间小屋 ).

A voice called out from the furthest one through an open door:

“Deta, please wait one moment! I am coming with you, if you are going further up.”

When the girl stood still to wait, the child instantly( 立即 ) let go of her hand and quickly sat down on the ground.

“Are you tired, Heidi?” Deta asked the child.

“No, but hot,” she replied.

“We shall be up in an hour, if you take big steps and climb with all your little might!”

Thus the elder girl tried to encourage her small companion( 同伴 ).

A strong, pleasant-looking woman stepped out of the hut and joined the two.

The child had risen and wandered( 漫步 ) behind the old friends.

Deta and the other girl immediately started talking about their friends in the neighborhood and the people of the village.

“Where are you taking the child, Deta?” asked Barbara, the newcomer.

“Is she the child your sister left?”

“Yes,” Deta told her,

“I am taking her up to the Alm-Uncle and I want her to remain there.”

“You can’t really mean to take her there Deta.

You must have lost your senses.

I am sure the old man will show you the door and won’t even listen to what you say.”

“Why not?

As he’s her grandfather, it is high time he should do something for the child.

I have taken care of her until this summer and now a good place has been offered to me.

The child shall not stop me from accepting it!”

“It would not be so hard, if he were like other people.

But you know him yourself.

How could he look after a child, especially such a little one?

She’ll never get along with him, I am sure of that!—But tell me of your plans.”

“I am going to a splendid( 华丽的 ) hut in Frankfurt( 地名，法兰克福 ).

Last summer some people went off to the Baths and I took care of their rooms.

As they got to like me, they wanted to take me along, but I could not leave.

They have come back now and have persuaded( 说服 ) me to go with them.”

“I am glad I am not the child!” shouted Barbara shakily.

“Nobody knows anything about the old man’s life up there.

He doesn’t speak to a living soul( 活人 ), and from one year’s end to the other he keeps away from church.

People get out of his way when he appears once a year down here among us.

When he wanders along the road with his stick, we are all afraid to meet him alone.”

“That is not my fault( 错 ),” said Deta stubbornly( 倔强地 ).

“He won’t do her any harm; and if he should, he is responsible( 负有责任的 ), not I.”

“I wish I knew what goes on in the old man’s mind.

Why are his eyes so fierce( 凶猛的 ) and why does he live up there all alone?

Nobody ever sees him and we hear many strange things about him.

Didn’t your sister tell you anything, Deta?”

“Of course she did, but I shall hold my tongue( 默不作声 ).

He would make me pay for it if I didn’t.”

Barbara had long been anxious( 急切的 ) to know something about the old uncle and why he lived apart from everybody.

Nobody had a good word for him, and when people talked about him, they did not speak openly as if they were afraid.

She could not even explain why he was called the Alm-Uncle.

He could not possibly be the uncle of all the people in the village.

But since everybody called him so, she did the same.

Barbara, who had only lived in the village since her marriage, was glad to get some information from her friend.

Deta had grown up there, but had gone away to earn her own income( 谋生 ) since her mother’s death.

She confidentially( 悄悄地 ) seized( 抓住 ) Deta’s arm and said,

“I wish you would tell me the truth about him, Deta;

you know it all—people only gossip( 说长道短 ).

Tell me, what has happened to the old man to turn everybody against him so?

I promise I will keep things to myself!”
<hr>
“All right, but keep your word!” said Deta,

looking around to see that the child was not so close to them as to hear what might be said;

but the little girl was nowhere to be seen.

While the two young women had talked at such a rate, they had not noticed her absence;

quite some time must have passed since the little girl had given up following her companions( 同伴 ).

Deta, standing still, looked about her everywhere.

No one was on the path( 小路 ).

“There she is!” shouted Barbara,

pointing to a spot( 地点 ) a good distance from the path.

“She is climbing up with the goatherd( 牧羊人 ) Peter and his goats( 山羊 ).”

“It will be very easy for Peter to watch her,” remarked( 说 ) Deta;

“she is bright for her five years and keeps her eyes wide open.

I have often noticed that and I am glad for her, for it will be useful with the uncle.

He has nothing left in the whole wide world, but his cottage( 乡间小屋 ) and two goats!”

“Did he once have more?” asked Barbara.

“I should say so.

His parents used to have a large farm in Domleschg, which he received when they died.

But he lost everything by gambling( 赌博 ) and drinking, then he disappeared.

After many years he came back with a half-grown son, Tobias.

The boy became a worker who made the wooden support of buildings.

My mother’s grandmother was a cousin of his, so we called him uncle.

Because we are related on my father’s side to nearly all the people in the village, they too all called him uncle.

He was named ‘Alm-Uncle’ when he moved up to the Alm.”

“But what happened to Tobias?” asked Barbara eagerly( 急切地 ).

“Just wait. How can I tell you everything at once?” shouted Deta.

“Tobias married my sister Adelheid.

They lived a happy life, but their joy( 欢乐 ) was short.

Two years later, when Tobias was helping to build a house, a beam( 横梁 ) fell on him and killed him.

Adelheid was thrown into a violent( 急剧的 ) fever with sadness and fear, and never recovered( 康复 ) from it.

Only a few weeks after Tobias’s death, they buried( 埋葬 ) poor Adelheid.

“People said that heaven( 天堂 ) had punished the uncle for what he had done wrong.

After the death of his son, he never spoke to a living soul( 活人 ).

Suddenly he moved up to the Alm, to live there as an enemy of God and the people.”

“My mother and I took Adelheid’s little baby, Heidi, to live with us.

When I went to Ragatz I took her with me;

but in the spring, the family that I had worked for last year decided to take me to their townhouse( 城镇住房 ) in Frankfurt.

I am very glad to get such a good position.”

“And now you want to hand over the child to this terrible old man.

I really wonder how you can do it, Deta!” said Barbara with blame( 责备 ) in her voice.

“I have really done enough for the child.

I do not know where else to take her, as she is too young to come with me to Frankfurt.

By the way, Barbara, where are you going?

We are halfway up the Alm already.”

“Almost there!” said Barbara.

Deta shook hands with her companion and stood still.

Barbara approached a tiny, dark brown mountain hut( 小屋 ),

which lay in a hollow( 凹陷处 ) a few steps away from the path.

Situated halfway up the Alm, the cottage was luckily protected from the mighty winds.

Still, the doors and windows made noise,

and the old hut shook when the south wind swept( 掠过 ) the mountain side.

Here lived Peter the goatherd, who was eleven years old.

Every day, he fetched( 取 ) the goats from the village and drove them up the mountain to the short and green grass.

Peter raced down in the evening with the light-footed little goats.

When he whistled( 吹口哨 ) loudly through his fingers, every owner would come and get his or her goats.

At home lived his mother and an old blind grandmother, but he only spent time in the hut for breakfast and dinner.

His father, who had met with an accident( 意外 ) some years ago, also had been called Peter the goatherd.

His mother, Brigida, was called “Goatherd Peter’s wife”

and his blind grandmother was called just “grandmother” by young and old from many miles about.

Deta waited to see if the two children were coming up behind with the goats.

As she could not find them anywhere, she climbed up a little higher to get a better view.

She looked from side to side, with marks of great impatience( 不耐烦 ) on her face.

During this time, the children were climbing up the mountain slowly in a zigzag( 之字形的 ) way.

Peter always knew where to find all sorts of good places for his goats where they could eat the grass.

The poor little girl had followed the boy with the greatest effort and she was breathing( 呼吸 ) heavily in her heavy clothes.

Suddenly sitting down on the ground, the child quickly took off her shoes and stockings( 袜子 ).

Getting up, she took off the heavy scarf and the two little dresses.

She took everything off and stood up in only a light skirt.

To save the trouble of carrying them, her aunt had dressed her in her Sunday clothes over her everyday clothes.
<hr>
Heidi arranged( 整理 ) her dresses tidily in a pile( 堆 ) and joined Peter and the goats( 山羊 ).

When Peter saw her suddenly in her light clothes, he smiled.

Looking back, he saw the little pile of dresses on the ground and then he smiled even more.

The child, feeling free and comfortable, started to converse with Peter, and he had to answer many questions.

She asked him how many goats he had, where he led them, what he did with them when he got there, and so forth( 等等 ).

At last the children reached the mountain peak( 山顶 ) in front of the hut( 小屋 ).

When Deta saw the little party of climbers, she cried out in a high voice:

“Heidi, what have you done?

Where are your dresses and your scarf, and your new shoes and new stockings( 袜子 )?”

The child quietly pointed down and said,

“There.”

The aunt followed the direction of her finger and saw a little pile.

In the middle of the pile was a small red dot( 圆点 ), which she recognized( 认出 ) as the scarf.

“Unlucky child!” Deta said angrily.

“What does all this mean? Why have you taken your things all off?”

“Because I do not need them,” said the child, who did not regret her deed( 行为 ) at all.

“How can you be so stupid, Heidi? Have you lost your senses?”

the aunt went on, with a mix of anger and blame( 责备 ) in her voice.

“Who do you think will go way down there to fetch( 拿 ) those things up again?

It is a half-hour walk.

Please, Peter, run down and get them.”

“I am late already,” replied Peter, with his hands in his trousers’ pockets.

He stood without moving from the place where he had witnessed( 看见 ) the violent( 狂暴的 ) outbreak of Heidi’s aunt.

“There you are, standing and staring( 盯 ), but that won’t get you further,” said Deta.

“I’ll give you this if you go down.”

With that she held a five-penny piece under his eyes.

That made Peter start and in a great hurry he ran down the straightest path( 小路 ).

He arrived again in so short a time that Deta had to praise him and gave him her little coin without delay( 延迟 ).

He did not often get such a treasure, and therefore he happily dropped the money deep into his pocket.

“If you are going up to the uncle, as we are, you can carry the pack( 包裹 ) till we get there,” said Deta.

They still had to climb up the steep( 陡峭的 ) part of the mountain that lay behind Peter’s hut.

The boy readily took the things and followed Deta.

Heidi jumped along happily by his side with the goats.

After three quarters of an hour, they reached the height where the hut of the old man stood on a big rock.

The small house had no protection from the wind, but bathed( 沐浴 ) in the full sunlight.

From there you could see far down into the valley( 山谷 ).

Behind the hut stood three old fir( 冷杉 ) trees with great branches( 树枝 ).

Further back the old gray rocks rose high.

Above them you could see green grass, till at last nothing could grow on the stony rocks.

By the side of the hut the uncle had made himself a bench( 长凳 ), from which one could look over the valley.

Here he sat, with his pipe( 烟斗 ) between his teeth and both hands resting on his knees.

He quietly watched the children climbing up with the goats and Aunt Deta behind them,

for the children had caught up to her long ago.

Heidi reached the top first.

Approaching the old man, she held out her hand to him and said:

“Good evening, grandfather!”

“Well, well, what does that mean?” replied the old man in a rough( 粗哑的 ) voice.

Giving her his hand for only a moment, he watched her with a long and serious look from under his bushy( 浓密的 ) eyebrows( 眉毛 ).

Heidi examined him with much curiosity( 好奇心 ).

He was strange to look at, with his thick, gray beard( 胡须 ) and long eyebrows.

Heidi’s aunt had arrived with Peter, who was eager to see what was going to happen.

“Good day to you, uncle,” said Deta as she approached.

“This is Tobias and Adelheid’s child.

You won’t be able to remember her, because last time you saw her she was only a year old.”

“Why do you bring her here?” asked the uncle, and turning to Peter he said,

“Get away and bring my goats. How late you are already!”

The uncle looked at him angrily.

Peter obeyed( 听从 ) and disappeared on the spot( 立刻 ).

“Uncle, I have brought the little girl for you to keep,” said Deta.

“I have done my share these last four years and now it is your turn to provide for her.”

The old man’s eyes flamed( 发红 ) with anger.

“Indeed!” he said.

“What on earth shall I do, when she begins to cry for you?

Small children always do, and then I’ll be helpless.”

“You’ll have to look out for that!” Deta replied.

“When the little baby was left in my hands a few years ago, I had to find out how to care for her myself.

Nobody told me anything!

You can’t blame me if I want to earn( 挣 ) some money now.

If you can’t keep the child, you can do with her whatever you want.

If she comes to harm, you are responsible( 负有责任的 ).

And I am sure you do not want to feel worse than you already do.”
<hr>
Deta had said in a higher voice than she had wanted, just because her conscience( 良知 ) was not quite clear.

The uncle had risen during her last words and now he gave her such a look that she stepped back a little.

Holding out his arm in a commanding( 指挥的 ) gesture( 手势 ), he said to her,

“Away with you! Stay wherever you came from and don’t come back again!”

Deta did not have to be told twice.

She said “Goodbye” to Heidi and “Farewell( 再见 )” to the uncle, and started down the mountain.

She ran down very quickly as if she were driven by steam( 蒸汽 ).

On her way downward( 向下的 ), people called to her more because they wondered where she had left the child.

Deta ran as quickly as she could and was glad when she heard no more calls.

But, to tell the truth, Deta was uneasy.

Her mother had asked her to care for Heidi when she died.

But she eased herself with the thought that she would be able to do more for the child if she could earn( 挣 ) some money.

She was very glad to go away from people who wanted to involve themselves in her affairs( 事务 ),

and she looked forward with great delight( 高兴 ) to her new place.

After Deta had disappeared, the Uncle sat down again on the bench( 长凳 ), blowing big clouds of smoke out of his pipe( 烟斗 ).

He did not speak, but kept his eyes fastened on( 集中注意力于... ) the ground.

Heidi looked about her.

Discovering( 发现 ) the small shed( 棚 ) where the goats lived, she walked in.

Nothing could be seen inside.

Searching for something more interesting, she saw the three old fir( 冷杉 ) trees behind the hut.

Here the wind was blowing loudly through the branches( 树枝 ) and the tree-tops were moving from one side to another.

Heidi stood still to listen.

After the wind had become less strong, she walked around the hut back to her grandfather.

She found him in exactly the same position.

She planted herself in front of the old man and looked at him, with arms folded( 交叠 ) behind her back.

The grandfather, looking up, saw the child standing still before him.

“What do you want to do now?” he asked her.

“I want to see what’s in the hut,” replied Heidi.

“All right, you can; but fetch( 拿 ) the things and we’ll put them in the cupboard( 橱柜 ).” The child obeyed( 服从 ) the command.

The old man now opened the door, and Heidi followed him into a fairly spacious( 宽敞的 ) room.

In one corner stood a table and a chair, and in another the grandfather’s bed.

Across the room a large kettle( 壶 ) hung over the fire.

The grandfather opened the cupboard, in which all his clothes were kept.

In one shelf( 架子 ) were a few shirts, socks and towels( 毛巾 );

on another a few plates( 盘子 ), cups and glasses;

and on the top shelf Heidi could see a round loaf of( 一条 ) bread, some bacon( 熏肉 ) and cheese( 奶酪 ).

Heidi pushed her things as far behind the grandfather’s clothes as she could reach.

She did not want them found again in a hurry.

After looking around in the room, she asked,

“Where am I going to sleep, grandfather?”

“Wherever you want to,” he replied.

That suited( 合...的心意 ) Heidi exactly.

She looked into all the corners of the room and looked at every little space to find a nice place to sleep.

Beside the old man’s bed she saw a ladder( 梯子 ).

Climbing up, she arrived at a place which was filled with fresh and fragrant( 芳香的 ) hay( 干草 ).

Through a tiny round window, she could look far down into the valley.

“I want to sleep up here,” Heidi called down.

“Oh, it is lovely here. Please come up, grandfather, and see it for yourself.”

“I know it,” the grandfather’s voice came from below.

“I am making the bed now,” the little girl called out again, while she ran busily to and fro.

“Oh, do come up and bring a sheet( 床单 ), grandfather, for every bed must have a sheet.”

“Is that so?” said the old man.

After a while he opened the cupboard and looked around in it.

At last he pulled out a long rough( 粗糙的 ) cloth( 布 ) from under the shirts.

It somewhat looked like a sheet, and with this he climbed up to the loft( 阁楼 ).

Here a tidy little bed was already prepared.

Heidi looked thoughtfully at her fresh, new bed and said,

“Grandfather, we have forgotten something.”

“What?” he asked.

“I have no cover.

When I go to bed, I always sleep between the sheet and the cover.”

“What shall we do if I don’t have any?” asked the grandfather.

“Never mind, I’ll just take some more hay to cover me,” Heidi told him.

She was just going to the pile( 堆 ) of hay when the old man stopped her.

“Just wait one minute,” he said, and went down to his own bed.

From it he took a large, heavy bag and brought it to the child.

“Isn’t this better than hay?” he asked.

Heidi pulled the bag to and fro with all her might, but it was too heavy for her to unfold( 展开 ) it.

The grandfather put the thick cover on the bed while Heidi watched him.

After it was all done, she said,

“What a nice bed I have now!

I only wish the night was here, so that I might go to sleep in it.”
<hr>
“I think we might eat something first,” said the grandfather.

“Don’t you think so?”

Heidi had forgotten everything else in her interest for the bed;

but when she was reminded( 被提醒 ) of her dinner, she noticed how terribly hungry she really was.

Heidi said happily,

“I think we might, grandfather!”

“Let’s go down then, if we agree,” said the old man, and followed close behind her.

When the kettle( 壶 ) was boiling( 煮沸 ), the old man put a large piece of cheese( 奶酪 ) on a long iron fork.

He held it over the fire, turning it till it was golden-brown on all sides.

Heidi had watched him eagerly( 急切地 ).

Suddenly she ran to the cupboard( 橱柜 ).

Grandfather brought a pot( 盆 ) and the toasted( 烤的 ) cheese to the table.

Heidi had already set it with two plates( 盘子 ) and two knives and the bread in the middle.

Heidi had seen the things in the cupboard and knew that they would be needed for the meal.

“I am glad to see that you can think for yourself,” said the grandfather,

and he put the cheese on top of the bread.

Heidi had never enjoyed her dinner more.

After they finished, the night came.

The old fir( 冷杉 ) trees were moving and a mighty wind was blowing loudly through the tree-tops.

Suddenly a high whistle( 哨声 ) was heard.

Heidi ran outside and the grandfather joined her.

Down from the heights came one goat( 山羊 ) after another, with Peter in their middle.

When they had all reached the hut( 小屋 ), they stopped on their way

and two beautiful thin goats separated themselves from the group.

One of them was white and the other was brown.

They came up to the grandfather, who held out some salt in his hands to them, as he did every night.

Heidi tenderly( 温柔地 ) touched the first one and then the other.

“Are they ours, grandfather?

Do they both belong to( 属于 ) us?

Are they going to the shed( 棚 ) over there?

Are they going to stay with us?” Heidi kept on asking in her excitement.

The grandfather hardly could put in a “yes, yes, surely” between her many questions.

When the goats had eaten up all the salt, the old man said,

“Go in, Heidi, and fetch( 拿 ) your bowl( 碗 ) and the bread.”

Heidi obeyed( 听从 ) and returned instantly( 立即 ).

The grandfather milked a full bowl from the white goat, cut a piece of bread for the child, and told her to eat.

“Afterwards( 然后 ) you can go to bed.

If you need some shirts and other clothes, you will find them in the bottom of the cupboard.

Aunt Deta has left a bundle( 一包 ) for you.

Now good night, I have to look after the goats and lock them up for the night.”

“Good night, grandfather! Oh, please tell me what their names are,” called Heidi after him.

“The white one’s name is Schwänli and the brown one I call Bärli,” was his answer.

“Good night, Schwänli! Good night, Bärli,” the little girl called loudly.

Heidi now sat down on the bench( 长凳 ) and took her supper( 晚餐 ).

The strong wind nearly blew her from her seat, so she hurried with her meal.

Then she went inside and up to her bed.

Very soon after Heidi had gone up, before it was quite dark, the old man also sought his bed( 就寝 ).

It was a wild, stormy night;

the hut was shaking and all the boards were creaking( 嘎吱作响 ).

In the middle of the night the grandfather got up, saying to himself:

“I am sure she is afraid.”

Climbing up the ladder( 梯子 ), he went up to Heidi’s bed.

Her cheeks( 脸颊 ) were burning red and she lay peacefully on her round arms.

She must have had a happy dream, for she was smiling in her sleep.

The grandfather stood and watched her till a cloud flew over the moon and left everything in total darkness.

Then he went down to seek his bed again.

Heidi was awakened early next morning by a loud whistle.

Opening her eyes, she saw her little bed and the hay( 干草 ) bathed( 沐浴 ) in golden sunlight.

Jumping out of bed, she went down the ladder and ran outside.

Peter was already there with his goats, waiting for Schwänli and Bärli,

whom the grandfather was just bringing to join the other goats.

“Do you want to go with him to the pasture( 牧场 )?” asked the grandfather.

“Yes,” cried Heidi, clapping( 拍手 ) her hands.

Before they went, the grandfather put into Peter’s bag a piece of bread and some cheese.

They were easily twice as large as those the boy had in the bag himself.

“The little bowl goes in, too,” said the Uncle.

“The child does not know how to drink straight from the goat.

She is going to stay with you all day; therefore milk two bowls full for her lunch.

Look out that she does not fall over the rocks!”

Heidi and Peter started merrily( 兴高采烈地 ) up the Alp.

A cloudless, deep blue sky looked down on them, for the wind had driven away every little cloud in the night.

The fresh green mountainside( 山坡 ) was bathed in brilliant( 灿烂的 ) sunlight.

Heidi was wild with joy( 欢乐 ) and ran from side to side.

She saw beautiful red, blue, and golden flowers everywhere between the green grass.

In her pleasure at finding such treasures, Heidi even forgot Peter and his goats.

She ran far ahead of him and then walked away off to one side, for the bright flowers brought her here and there.

Picking a lot of them to take home with her, she put them all into her little apron( 围裙 ).
<hr>
Peter had a hard time looking out for her.

The goats were even worse, and only by shouting and whistling( 吹口哨 ),

especially by swinging( 挥 ) his rod( 杆 ), could he drive them together.

“Heidi, where are you now?” he called quite angrily.

“Here,” it sounded from somewhere.

Peter could not see her, for she was sitting on the ground behind a little hill, which was covered with fragrant( 芳香的 ) flowers.

The whole air was filled with their smell, and the child drew it in, in long breaths( 呼吸 ).

“Follow me now!” Peter called out.

“The grandfather has told me to look out for you, and you must not fall over the rocks.”

“Where are they?” asked Heidi.

“Way up there, and we have still far to go.

If you come quickly, we may see the eagle( 鹰 ) there and hear him scream( 发出尖锐的声音 ).”

That got Heidi’s attention, and she came running to Peter, with her apron( 围裙 ) full of flowers.

“You have enough now,” he said.

“If you pick them all today, there won’t be any left tomorrow.”

Heidi admitted( 承认 ) that, and from now on she stayed at Peter’s side.

After they had reached their destination( 目的地 ), the boy took off his bag, putting it in a little hollow( 低洼处 ) in the ground.

Then he lay down in the sunny grass, for he was very tired.

Heidi, taking off her apron, rolled( 卷 ) it together and put it beside Peter’s bag.

Then, sitting down beside the boy, she looked around her.

Far down she saw the bright valley( 山谷 ); a large field of snow rose high in front of her.

Heidi sat a long time without moving, with Peter asleep by her side and the goats climbing about between the bushes( 灌木丛 ).

Suddenly she heard a loud, high scream, and looking up she saw the largest bird she had ever seen flying above her.

With wings spreading wide, he flew in large circles over Heidi’s head.

“Wake up, Peter!” Heidi called.

“Look up, Peter, and see the eagle there!”

Peter got wide wake, and then they both watched the bird breathlessly( 屏息地 ).

It rose higher and higher into the blue sky, till it disappeared at last behind the mountain peak( 山顶 ).

“Where has it gone?” Heidi asked.

“Home to its nest( 巢 ),” was Peter’s answer.

“Oh, let’s climb up there and see its nest!” said Heidi,

but Peter, expressing decided disapproval( 反对 ) in his voice, answered:

“Oh dear, not even goats could climb up there!

Grandfather has told me not to let you fall down the rocks, so we can’t go!”

Peter now began to call loudly and to whistle, and soon all the goats gathered( 集合 ) together on the green field.

Heidi ran into the middle of them, for she loved to see them jumping and playing about.

At the same time, Peter was preparing lunch for Heidi and himself.

He put her large pieces on one side and his own small ones on the other.

Then he milked Bärli and put the full bowl in the middle.

When he was ready, he called to the little girl.

But it took some time before she obeyed his call.

“Stop jumping, now,” said Peter,

“and sit down; your lunch is ready.”

“Is this milk for me?” she asked.

“Yes, it is; those large pieces also belong to( 属于 ) you.

When you are through with the milk, I’ll get you some more.

After that I’ll get mine.”

“What milk do you get?” Heidi asked.

“I get it from my own goat. But go ahead and eat!” Peter commanded( 命令 ) again.

Heidi obeyed, and when the bowl was empty, he filled it again.

Breaking off a piece of bread for herself, she gave Peter the rest, which was still bigger than his own piece.

She also handed him the whole slice( 片 ) of cheese, saying:

“You can eat that, I have had enough!”

Peter was speechless with surprise, for it would have been impossible for him ever to give up any of his share.

Not taking Heidi seriously, he doubted till she put the things on his knees.

Then he saw she really meant it, and he seized( 抓住 ) his prize.

Nodding his thanks to her, he ate the best meal he had ever had in all his life.

Heidi was watching the goats, and asked Peter for their names.

The boy could tell them all to her, for their names were about the only thing he had to carry in his head.

She soon knew them, too.

One of them was the Big Turk, who tried to stick his big horns( 角 ) into all the others.

Most of the goats ran away from that rough( 粗野的 ) comrade( 伙伴 ).

The brave Thistlefinch alone was not afraid.

A small, white goat, called Snowhopper, kept making sounds in the saddest way, which made Heidi comfort it several times.

Throwing her arms around its head, she asked,

“What is the matter with you, Snowhopper? Why do you always cry for help?”

The little goat pressed close to Heidi’s side and became perfectly quiet.

Peter was still eating, but between the swallows( 吞咽 ) he called to Heidi:

“She is so unhappy, because the old goat was sold to somebody in Mayenfeld two days ago.”

“Who was the old goat?”

“Her mother, of course.”

“Poor little Snowhopper!” said Heidi, drawing the little creature( 生物 ) lovingly to her.

“Don’t be sad anymore;

see, I am coming up with you every day now, and if there is anything the matter, you can come to me.”

Snowhopper pressed her head against Heidi’s shoulder and stopped making any sound.

When Peter had finally finished his lunch, he joined Heidi.
<hr>
The little girl had just been observing( 发现 ) that Schwänli and Bärli were by far the cleanest and prettiest of the goats.

She mentioned it to Peter, who replied:

“I know! Of course they are the prettiest, because the uncle washes them and gives them salt.

He has the best goat shed( 棚 ) by far.”

All of a sudden, Peter, who had been lying on the ground, jumped up and ran after the goats.

Heidi, knowing that something must have happened, followed him.

She saw him running to a dangerous cliff( 悬崖 ) on the side of the mountain.

Peter had noticed how Thistlefinch had gone nearer and nearer to the dangerous spot( 地点 ).

He only just came in time to prevent( 防止 ) the goat from falling down over the very edge.

After he led back the goat with Heidi’s help and had the goat in safety, he raised his rod( 杆 ) to beat it for punishment.

The goat stepped back shyly, for it knew what was coming.

Heidi screamed( 尖叫 ) loudly:

“Peter, no, do not beat him! Look how scared( 害怕的 ) he is.”

“He well deserves( 应得 ) it,” shouted Peter, ready to strike.

But Heidi seized( 抓住 ) his arms and shouted, full of anger about this unfairness:

“You mustn’t hurt him! Let him go!”

Heidi’s eyes were shining,

and when he saw her with her commanding( 威严的 ) expression, he stopped and dropped his rope.

“I’ll let him go, if you give me a piece of your cheese( 奶酪 ) again tomorrow,” he said.

“You may have it all tomorrow and every day, because I don’t need it,” Heidi said to him.

“I shall also give you a big piece of bread, if you promise never to beat any of the goats.”

“I don’t care,” said Peter, and in that way he gave his promise.

Thus the day had passed, and the sun was already sinking down( 下沉 ) behind the mountains.

Sitting on the grass, Heidi looked at the flowers that were shining in the last light of the sun.

The peaks( 山顶 ) also started to shine, and Heidi suddenly called to the boy:

“Oh, Peter, look! Everything is on fire.

Do you see the mountains all lit up?

Oh, how beautiful the snow looks!

Peter, the eagle’s nest( 巢 ) is surely on fire, too.

Oh, look at the fir( 冷杉 ) trees over there!”

Peter was quietly pulling pieces off his rod.

Looking up, he said to Heidi:

“This is no fire; it always looks like that.”

“But what is it then?” asked Heidi eagerly( 热切地 ).

“It gets that way of itself,” explained Peter.

“Oh, see, how beautiful!

It looks as if many, many roses were growing on those cliffs.

Oh, now they are getting gray.

Oh dear! The fire has gone out and it is all over.

What a terrible shame!” said Heidi quite sadly.

“It will be the same again tomorrow,” Peter told her.

“Come now, we have to go home.”

When Peter had called the goats together, they started on their way down.

“Will it be like that every day when we are up?” asked Heidi, eagerly.

“It usually is,” was the reply.

That made Heidi feel happy again.

At last, reaching the hut, they found the grandfather waiting for them on a bench( 长凳 ) under the fir trees.

Heidi ran up to him and the two goats followed, for they knew their master( 主人 ).

Peter called to her:

“Come again tomorrow! Good night!”

Heidi ran quickly back to Peter and gave him her hand, telling him that she would come.

Finding herself in the middle of the group of goats, she hugged( 拥抱 ) Snowhopper a last time.

When Peter had disappeared, Heidi returned to her grandfather.

“Oh grandfather! It was so beautiful!

I saw the fire and the roses on the rocks!

And see the many, many flowers I am bringing you!”

With that Heidi shook them out of her apron( 围裙 ).

But oh, how miserable( 悲惨的 ) they looked!

Heidi did not even know them anymore.

“What is the matter with them, grandfather?

They looked so different!” Heidi shouted in her fright( 惊恐 ).

“They are made to bloom( 绽放 ) in the sun and not to be shut up in an apron,” said the grandfather.

“Then I shall never pick them anymore!

Please, grandfather, tell me why the eagle screams so loudly,” asked Heidi.

“Because he is laughing at the people down below, who sit in the villages and make each other angry.

He calls down to them:

‘If you would go apart to live up on the heights like me, you would feel much better!’ ”

The grandfather said these last words with such a wild voice, that it reminded Heidi of the eagle’s scream.

The child told him about the wonderful fire.

She asked how it came about.

“The sun does it,” he said.

“Saying good night to the mountains, the sun throws his most beautiful light to them,

that they may not forget him till the morning.”

Heidi was so much pleased with this explanation that she could hardly wait to see the sun say good night again.

It was time now to go to bed, and Heidi slept soundly( 熟睡地 ) all night.

She dreamed that the little Snowhopper was jumping happily about on the shining mountains with many beautiful roses blooming round her.

Next morning Peter came again with his goats, and Heidi went up to the pasture( 牧场 ) with them.

This happened day after day, and in this healthy life Heidi grew stronger.

Soon the autumn came and when the wind was blowing across the mountains,

the grandfather would say:

“You must stay home today, Heidi;

for the wind can blow such a little thing as you down into the valley.”
<hr>
It always made Peter unhappy when Heidi did not come along, for he hardly knew how to pass his time,

and besides, he did not get his extra( 额外的 ) lunch.

The goats were so used to Heidi by this time that they did not follow Peter when she was not with him.

Heidi herself did not mind staying at home, for she loved watching her grandfather with his saw and hammer( 锤子 ).

He would walk around the hut, fastening( 加固 ) a nail( 钉子 ) or a loose( 松的 ) board here and there.

Sometimes the grandfather would make small round cheeses( 奶酪 ) on those days.

There was no greater pleasure for Heidi than to see him mix the butter( 黄油 ) with his bare( 赤裸的 ) arms.

The weather got colder and colder, and at last even Peter could not come anymore, for a deep snow had fallen overnight( 突然 ).

It kept on snowing till it reached the windows, and soon the windows could not be opened, and they were all shut in.

When it had lasted for several days, Heidi thought that it would soon cover up the cottage( 乡间小屋 ).

It finally stopped, and the grandfather went out to clean the snow from the door and windows.

In the afternoon the two were sitting near the fire when noisy steps were heard outside and the door was pushed open.

It was Peter, who had come up to see Heidi.

He said, “Good evening,” in a low voice and went up to the fire.

“Well, how is it going with you?” said the grandfather. “Now that it has gotten colder and you can't go out with the goats anymore, you will have to turn to your pen and pencil."

“Why must he turn to his pen and pencil?” asked Heidi immediately, full of curiosity.

“During the winter he must go to school,” explained her grandfather, “and learn how to read and write; it's a bit hard, but useful sometimes afterwards.”

Heidi was so interested that she asked him a hundred questions.

Poor Peter, who was not an easy talker, found himself in great difficulty answering the little girl’s questions.

It had begun to get dark.

Peter had said goodbye and thank you, when turning to Heidi he remarked( 说 ):

“I’ll come next Sunday, if I may.

By the way, Heidi, grandmother asked me to tell you that she would love to see you.”

Heidi thought this was a good idea, and her first word next morning was:

“Grandfather, I must go down to grandmother. She is expecting me.”

Four days later the sun was shining and the frozen( 冰冻的 ) snow was crackling( 噼啪作响 ) under every step.

Heidi in her pleasure was running from here to there:

“Grandfather, come out! Oh, look at the trees! They are all covered with silver and gold,”

she called to the grandfather, who had just come out of his working place with a wide sled( 雪橇 ).

Wrapping( 包 ) the child up in her cover, he put her on the sled, holding her fast.

Off they started at such a pace( 速度 ) that Heidi shouted for joy( 欢乐 ), for she seemed to be flying like a bird.

The sled had stopped in front of Peter’s hut, and grandfather said:

“Go in. When it gets dark, start on your way home.”

When he had taken off her cover, he went home with his sled.

Opening the door, Heidi found herself in a tiny, dark kitchen.

Going through another door, she entered a narrow( 狭小的 ) room.

Near a table a woman was seated, busy with mending( 修补 ) Peter’s coat, which Heidi had recognized( 认出 ) immediately.

A bent( 驼背的 ) old woman was sitting in a corner, and Heidi, approaching her at once, said:

“How do you do, grandmother? I hope I haven’t kept you waiting too long!”

Lifting her head, the grandmother sought( 寻找 ) for Heidi’s hand.

Feeling it thoughtfully, she said:

“Are you the little girl who lives up with the uncle? Is your name Heidi?”

“Yes,” Heidi replied.

“The grandfather just brought me down in the sled.”

“How is it possible? Your hands are as warm as toast( 烤面包片 )!

Brigida, did the uncle really come down with the child?”

Brigida, Peter’s mother, had gotten up to look at the child. She said:

“I don’t know if he did, but I don’t think so. She probably doesn’t know.”

Heidi, looking up, said quite decidedly:

“I know that grandfather put a cover around me when we came down together.”

“Peter was right,” said the grandmother.

“We never thought the child would live more than three weeks with him.

Brigida, tell me what she looks like.”

“She has Adelheid’s fine arms and legs and black eyes, and she has hair like Tobias.

I think she looks like both of them.”

While the women were talking, Heidi had been taking in everything.

Then she said:

“Grandmother, look at the shutter( 百叶窗 ) over there.

It is not fastened( 被拉好 ). If grandfather were here, he would fasten it.”

“What a sweet child you are,” said the grandmother tenderly( 温柔地 ).

“I can hear it, but I cannot see it, child.

Someday the whole house will break to pieces and fall on top of us.

If only Peter knew how to mend it!”

“Why, grandmother, can’t you see the shutter?” asked Heidi.

“Child, I cannot see anything,” said the old woman sadly.

“Can you see it when I open the shutter to let in the light?”

“No. Nobody can ever show me the light again.”

“But you can see when you go out into the snow, where everything is bright.

Come with me, grandmother!”

and Heidi, taking the old woman by the hand, tried to lead her out.

“Just let me stay here, child.

Everything is dark for me, and my poor eyes can neither see the snow nor the light.”

Heidi burst out crying( 大哭起来 ) now and said aloud.

“Can nobody make you see the light? Nobody?”

It was awfully hard for Heidi to stop crying when she had once begun.

The grandmother said:

“Heidi, let me tell you something.

People who cannot see love to listen to friendly words.

Sit down beside me and tell me all about yourself.

Talk to me about your grandfather, for it has been long since I have heard anything about him. I used to know him very well.”
<hr>
Heidi suddenly wiped away( 擦掉 ) her tears( 眼泪 ), for she had had a cheering thought.

“Grandmother, I shall tell grandfather about it, and I am sure he can make you see the light again. He can mend( 修补 ) your little house and stop the sound.”

The old woman remained silent, and Heidi, with the greatest liveliness, began to describe her life with the grandfather.

Heidi’s tale( 讲述 ) was interrupted( 被打断 ) suddenly by a loud knocking on the door; and Peter came in.

No sooner had he seen Heidi than he smiled, opening his round eyes as wide as possible.

Heidi called, “Good evening, Peter!”

“Is it really time for him to come home!” said Peter’s grandmother in surprise.

“How quickly the time has flown.

Good evening, little Peter; how is your reading going?”

“Just the same,” the boy replied.

“Oh, dear, I was hoping for a change at last.

You are nearly twelve years old, my boy.”

“Why should there be a change?” asked Heidi with greatest interest.

“I am afraid he’ll never learn it after all.

On the shelf( 架子 ) over there is an old prayer( 祈祷 ) book with beautiful songs.

I longed that Peter should read them to me some day, but he will never be able to!”

Peter’s mother got up from her work now, saying,

“I must make a light. The afternoon has passed and now it’s getting dark.”

When Heidi heard those words, she said:

“Good night. I have to go, for it is getting dark.”

But the anxious( 忧虑的 ) grandmother called out:

“Wait, child, don’t go up alone!

Go with her, Peter, and take care that she does not fall.

Don’t let her get cold, do you hear?

Does Heidi have a scarf?”

“I don’t, but I won’t be cold,” Heidi called back, for she had already run through the door.

She ran so fast that Peter could hardly follow her.

The old woman worriedly called out:

“Brigida, run after her. Get a warm scarf, she’ll freeze( 结冰 ) in this cold night. Hurry up!” Brigida obeyed( 服从 ).

The children had hardly climbed any distance, when they saw the old man coming and with a few strong steps he stood beside them.

“I am glad you kept your word, Heidi,” he said.

Packing( 裹 ) her into her cover, he started up the hill, carrying the child in his arms.

Brigida had come in time to see it, and told the grandmother what she had witnessed( 看见 ).

“Thank God!” the old woman said.

“I hope she’ll come again; she has done me so much good!

What a soft heart she has, the darling( 亲爱的 ), and how nicely she can talk.”

All evening the grandmother said to herself,

“If only he lets her come again!”

Heidi could hardly wait before they reached the cottage( 乡间小屋 ).

As soon as they were inside the hut she began:

“Grandfather, we must take some nails( 钉子 ) and a hammer( 锤子 ) down tomorrow;

a shutter( 百叶窗 ) is not fastened( 牢固 ) in grandmother’s house and many other places shake.”

“Is that so? Who says we must?”

“Nobody told me, but I know,” Heidi replied.

“Nothing in the house is fixed, and poor grandmother told me she was afraid that the house might fall down.

And grandfather, she cannot see the light.

Can you help her and make her see the light again? ”

Heidi had been holding on to her grandfather and looking up to him with trusting eyes.

At last he said, glancing down( 向下扫视 ):

“All right, child, we’ll see that it won’t make any sounds.

We can do it tomorrow.”

Heidi was so happy at these words that she danced around the room shouting:

“We’ll do it tomorrow! We can do it tomorrow!”

The grandfather, keeping his word, took Heidi down the following day with the same instructions as before.

After Heidi had disappeared, he went around the house examining it.

The grandmother called:

“Here is the child again!”

Heidi, grasping( 抓住 ) her hands, sat herself on a low chair at the old woman’s feet and began to chat( 聊天 ).

Suddenly violent( 猛烈的 ) blows( 爆裂 ) were heard outside;

the grandmother in her fright( 恐惧 ) nearly upset( 弄翻 ) the spinning-wheel( 纺车 ) and screamed( 尖叫 ):

“Oh, God! The hut is falling down!”

“Grandmother, don’t be frightened( 感到害怕的 ),” said the child.

“Grandfather is just fixing everything for you.”

“Is it possible? Has God not forgotten us after all?

Brigida, have you heard it? Surely that is a hammer.

Ask him to come in a moment, for I must thank him.”

When Brigida went out, she found the old man busy with putting a new beam( 横梁 ) along the wall.

Approaching him, she said:

“Mother and I wish you a good afternoon.

We are very thankful to you, and mother would like to see you.

Uncle, how can we thank you?”

“That will do,” he interrupted.

“I know what your opinion about me is. Go in, for I can find what needs fixing myself.”

Brigida obeyed.

All afternoon the uncle hammered around; he even climbed up on the roof( 屋顶 ), where much was missing.

At last he had to stop, for the last nail was gone from his pocket.

The darkness had come, and Heidi was ready to go up with him, packed warmly in his arms.

Thus the winter passed.

Sunshine had come again into the blind woman’s life, and made her days less dark and sad.

Early every morning she would begin to listen for Heidi’s footsteps.

When the door was opened and the child ran in, the grandmother exclaimed( 呼喊 ) joyfully( 高兴地 ):

“Thank God, she has come again!”
<hr>
Heidi would talk about her life,

and make the grandmother smile and laugh, and in that way the hours flew by.

Heidi became very fond of( 喜欢 ) the old grandmother,

and when the weather was fair, she visited her every day that winter.

Whenever the child remembered that the grandmother was blind, she would get very sad;

her only comfort was that her coming brought such happiness.

The grandfather soon had fixed the cottage( 乡间小屋 ).

The grandmother claimed that no noises could be heard anymore.

She also said that thanks to the uncle’s kindness, she slept better that winter than she had done for many a year.

Two winters had nearly passed.

Heidi was happy, for the spring was coming again, with the delicious( 令人愉快的 ) wind that made the fir( 冷杉 ) trees roar( 咆哮 ).

She was nearly eight years old, and had learned to take care of the goats( 山羊 ), who ran after her like little dogs.

Several times the village teacher had sent word by Peter that the child was wanted in school.

But the old man had not paid any attention to the message.

It was a beautiful morning in March.

Heidi was running to and fro before the door, when she suddenly saw an old gentleman, dressed in black, standing beside her.

As she appeared frightened( 感到害怕的 ), he said kindly,

“You must not be afraid of me, for I love children.

Give me your hand, Heidi, and tell me where your grandfather is.”

“He is inside,” the child replied, opening the door while she spoke.

The old gentleman was in charge of the church in the village.

He had known the grandfather years ago.

After entering, he approached the grandfather, saying:

“Good morning, neighbor.”

The grandfather got up, surprised, and offering a seat to the visitor, said,

“Good morning. Here is a wooden chair, if it is good enough.”

Sitting down, the gentleman said,

“It is long since I have seen you, neighbor.

I have come today to talk over a matter with you.

I am sure you can guess what it is about.”

The gentleman here looked at Heidi, who was standing near the door.

“Heidi, run out to see the goats,” said the grandfather,

“and bring them some salt; you can stay till I come.”

Heidi disappeared on the spot( 立即 ).

“The child should have come to school a year ago,” the gentleman went on to say.

“Didn’t you get the teacher’s warning? What do you intend( 打算 ) to do with the child?”

“I do not want her to go to school,” said the grandfather, decidedly.

“What do you want the child to be?”

“I want her to be free and happy as a bird!”

“But she is human, and it is high time for her to learn something.

I have come now to tell you about it, so that you can make your plans.

She must come to school next winter; remember that,” said the church man.

“I shan’t do it!” was the reply.

“You think I am going to send this delicate( 娇弱的 ) child to school in every storm and weather!”

“Why don’t you come down to live among us again?” said the gentleman kindly.

“I couldn’t live in the village, for the people there and I hate each other;

we had better keep apart.”

The gentleman had risen.

Holding out his hand, he said politely,

“I shall count on you next winter, neighbor.

We shall receive you gladly, when you make peace with God and man.”

But the uncle replied firmly:

“Thank you for your kindness, but you will have to wait in vain( 徒劳 ).”

“God be with you,” said the gentleman, and left him sadly.

The grandfather was out of humor that day,

and when Heidi begged( 乞求 ) to go to see the grandmother, he only said in a low voice: “Not today.”

Next day they had hardly finished their dinner, when another visitor arrived.

It was Heidi’s aunt Deta;

she wore a hat with feathers( 羽毛 ) and a dress with such a long train( 裙裾 ) that swept( 扫除 ) up the floor.

While the uncle looked at her silently, Deta began to praise him and the child’s red cheeks( 脸颊 ).

She told him that she had tried to provide for the child elsewhere,

and at last she had found a splendid( 极好的 ) chance for her in Frankfurt.

A rich relative of the lady, whom Deta had worked for, had a lame( 跛的 ) daughter.

This poor little girl could not leave her wheelchair and needed a companion( 同伴 ) at her lessons.

Deta had heard from her lady that a sweet child was wanted as playmate( 玩伴 ) and schoolmate for the disabled( 残疾的 ) girl.

She had gone to the housekeeper( 管家 ) and told her all about Heidi.

The lady, delighted( 高兴的 ) with the idea, had told her to fetch( 带 ) the child at once.

So she had come now, and it was a lucky chance for Heidi.

Deta said,

“Because one never knew what might happen in such a case, and who could tell—”

“Have you finished?” the old man interrupted( 打断 ) her at last.

“Why? One might think I was telling you the silliest things.

There is not a man who would not thank God for such news.”

“Bring them to somebody else, but not to me,” said the uncle coldly.

Deta, flaming up( 发起火来 ), replied:

“Do you want to hear what I think? Don’t I know how old she is?

Eight years old and ignorant( 无知的 ) of everything.

They have told me that you refuse to send her to church and to school.

You had better give way or I shall get the people to back me.”

“Be quiet!” the uncle thundered( 怒吼 ) with flaming( 愤怒的 ) eyes.

“Take her and ruin( 毁灭 ) her, but do not bring her before my sight again.

I do not want to see her with feathers in her hat and terrible words like yours.”

With big steps he walked out.
<hr>
“You have made him angry!” said Heidi, angrily.

“He won’t be mad long. But come now!” asked Deta.

“I won’t come,” Heidi replied.

“What?” Deta said in a heated way.

But changing her voice, she continued in a more friendly manner:

“Come now; you don’t understand me.

I am taking you to the most beautiful place you have ever seen.”

After packing up( 把...打包 ) Heidi’s clothes she said again,

“Come, child, and take your hat.”

“Don’t be stupid. Listen to me.

Grandfather is sending us away and we must do what he commands( 命令 ), or he will get more angry still.”

“Can I come home again tonight?” asked Heidi.

“Come now. If you don’t like it, you can come back.

If we get to Mayenfeld today, we can take the train tomorrow.

That will make you fly home again in the shortest time!”

Holding the clothes, Deta led the child down the mountain.

On their way they met Peter, who had not gone to school that day.

The boy thought it was more useful to spend his time looking for rods( 杆 ) than to learn to read.

After all, he always needed the rods.

When he caught sight of Heidi and Deta, he asked them where they were going.

“I am going to Frankfurt with Aunt Deta,” Heidi replied;

“but first I must see grandmother, for she is waiting.”

“Oh no, it is too late. You can see her when you come back,” said Deta, pulling Heidi along with her.

She was afraid that the old woman might keep the child.

Peter ran into the cottage( 乡间小屋 ) and hit the table with his rods.

The grandmother jumped up in her fright( 害怕 ) and asked him what that meant.

“They have taken Heidi away,” Peter said angrily.

“Who has, Peter? Where has she gone?” the unhappy grandmother asked.

Brigida had seen Deta walking up the footpath a short while ago and soon they guessed what had happened.

With a trembling( 颤抖的 ) hand, the old woman opened a window and called out as loudly as she could:

“Deta, Deta, don’t take the child away. Don’t take her from us.”

When Heidi heard that, she struggled( 挣扎 ) to get free, and said,

“I must go to grandmother; she is calling me.”

But Deta would not let her go.

She urged( 敦促 ) her on by saying that she might return soon again.

She also suggested that Heidi might bring a lovely present to the grandmother when she came back.

Heidi liked this prospect( 可能性 ) and followed Deta without trying to stay.

After a while she asked:

“What shall I bring to the grandmother?”

“You might bring her some soft white rolls( 面包卷 ), Heidi.

I think the black bread is too hard for poor grandmother to eat.”

“Yes, I know, aunt, she always gives it to Peter,” Heidi confirmed( 证实 ) her.

“We must go quickly now;

we might get to Frankfurt today and then I can be back tomorrow with the rolls.”

Heidi was running now, and Deta had to follow.

She was glad enough to escape( 逃避 ) the questions that people might ask her in the village.

People could see that Heidi was pulling her along, so she said,

“I can’t stop. Don’t you see how the child is hurrying?”

whenever she heard from all sides:

“Are you taking her with you?”

“Is she running away from the uncle?”

“What a wonder she is still alive!”

“What red cheeks( 脸颊 ) she has!” and so on.

Soon they had left the village far behind them.

From that time on, the uncle looked more angry than ever when he came to the village.

Everybody was afraid of him, and the women would warn their children to keep out of his sight.

He hardly ever came down, only to sell his cheese( 奶酪 ) and buy his provisions.

Often people remarked( 说 ) how lucky it was that Heidi had left him.

They had seen her hurrying away, so they thought that she had been glad to go.

The old grandmother alone continued to support him.

Whenever anybody came up to her, she would tell them what good care the old man had taken of Heidi.

She also told them that he had mended( 修补 ) her little house.

These reports reached the village, of course, but people only half believed them.

She began her days with sighing( 叹息 ) again.

“All happiness has left us with the child. The days are so long and boring.

If only I could hear Heidi’s voice before I die.”

the poor old woman would say, day after day.

In a beautiful house in Frankfurt lived a sick child by the name of Clara Sesemann.

She was sitting in a comfortable wheelchair, which could be pushed from room to room.

Clara spent most of her time in the study, where long rows of bookcases( 书架 ) lined the walls.

Clara had a pale, thin face with soft blue eyes, which at that moment were watching the clock impatiently( 不耐烦地 ).

At last she said,

“Oh Miss Rottenmeier, isn’t it time yet?”

The lady so addressed was the housekeeper( 管家 ), who had lived with Clara since Mrs. Sesemann’s death.

Clara’s father was away from home a great deal, leaving the entire management of the house to the lady.

While Clara was waiting, Deta had arrived with Heidi.

Following the maid( 女仆 ), they found themselves in the study.

Deta held on to Heidi’s hand and stayed near the door.
<hr>
Miss Rottenmeier, slowly getting up, approached the newcomers.

She did not seem pleased with Heidi, who wore her hat and scarf and was looking up at the lady’s headdress( 头饰 ) with innocent( 天真的 ) wonder.

“What is your name?” the lady asked.

“Heidi,” was the child’s clear answer.

“What? Is that a Christian( 基督教的 ) name? What name was given to you in church?” asked the lady again.

“I don’t remember that anymore,” the child replied.

“What an answer! What does that mean?” said the housekeeper( 管家 ), shaking her head.

“Is the child ignorant( 无知的 ) or impolite( 不礼貌的 ), Miss Deta?”

“I shall speak for the child, if I may, madam( 夫人 ),” Deta said,

after giving Heidi a little blow for her unacceptable answer.

“The child has never been in such a fine house and does not know how to behave( 举止得体 ).

She is called Adelheid after her mother, who was my sister.”

“Oh well, that is better. But Miss Deta, the child seems strange for her age.

I thought I told you that Miss Clara’s companion( 同伴 ) would have to be twelve years old like her, to be able to share her studies.

How old is Adelheid?”

“I am sorry, but I am afraid she is somewhat younger than I thought.

I think she is about ten years old.”

“Grandfather said that I was eight years old,” said Heidi.

Deta gave her another blow, but as the child had no idea why, she did not get embarrassed( 尴尬的 ).

“What, only eight years old!” Miss Rottenmeier shouted angrily.

“How can we get along? What have you learned? What books have you studied?”

“None,” said Heidi.

“But how did you learn to read?”

“I can’t read and Peter can’t do it either,” Heidi replied.

“What! You cannot read?” cried the lady in her surprise.

“How is it possible? What else have you studied?”

“Nothing,” replied Heidi, truthfully.

“Miss Deta, how could you bring this child?” asked the housekeeper.

Deta, however, was not easily afraid, and said,

“I am sorry, but I thought this child would suit( 符合 ) your needs.

She is small, but older children are often spoilt( 宠坏的 ) and not like her.

I must go now, for my mistress( 女主人 ) is waiting.

As soon as I can, I’ll come to see how the child is getting along.”

Soon she was outside and with a few quick steps she hurried downstairs( 下楼 ).

Miss Rottenmeier followed her and tried to call her back, for she wanted to ask Deta a number of questions.

Heidi was still standing in the same spot( 地方 ).

Clara had watched the scene, and called to the child to come to her.

Heidi approached the wheelchair.

“Do you want to be called Heidi or Adelheid?” asked Clara.

“My name is Heidi and nothing else,” was the child’s answer.

“I’ll call you Heidi then, for I like it very much,” said Clara.

“I have never heard the name before. What curly( 卷的 ) hair you have! Was it always like that?”

“I think so.”

“Did you like to come to Frankfurt( 地名，法兰克福 )?” asked Clara again.

“Oh, no, but then I am going home again tomorrow, and shall bring grandmother some soft white rolls( 面包卷 ),” Heidi explained.

“What a curious( 稀奇古怪的 ) child you are,” said Clara.

“You have come to Frankfurt to stay with me, don’t you know that?

We shall have our lessons together, and I think it will be great fun when you learn to read.

Generally the morning seems to have no end, for the tutor( 家庭教师 ) Mr. Candidate comes at ten and stays till two.

That is a long time, and he has to yawn( 打呵欠 ) himself, as he gets so tired.”

When Miss Rottenmeier found that she was unable to call Deta back, she came back to the children.

She was very annoyed( 生气的 ), for she felt responsible for( 对...负责 ) Heidi’s coming, and she did not know how to cancel this unfortunate( 不幸的 ) step.

She soon got up again to go to the dining room, shouting at the butler( 男管家 ) Sebastian and giving orders to the maid( 女仆 ).

When Sebastian went up to Clara’s chair, he saw Heidi watching him closely.

At last she said, “You look like Peter.”

Miss Rottenmeier was shocked( 震惊的 ) when Heidi said this, and sent them all into the dining room.

When Heidi saw a roll on her plate( 盘子 ), she turned to Sebastian, and pointing at it, asked,

“Can I have this?”

Heidi already trusted the butler, especially because she had discovered he looked like Peter.

The butler nodded, and when he saw Heidi put the bread in her pocket, he could hardly keep from laughing.

Miss Rottenmeier explained to Heidi with many signs how to help herself at table.

She also told her never to speak to Sebastian unless it was important.

When the question came up of how to call Clara, the older girl said,

“Of course you shall call me Clara.”

A great many rules followed about behavior( 行为 ) at all times.

Heidi was told about the shutting( 关 ) of doors and about going to bed, and a hundred other things.

Poor Heidi’s eyes were closing, for she had risen at five that morning, and resting against her chair she fell asleep.

When Miss Rottenmeier had finished instructions, she said,

“I hope you will remember everything, Adelheid. Did you understand me?”

“Heidi went to sleep a long time ago,” said Clara, highly amused( 愉快的 ).

“It is terrible that I have to bear with this child,” shouted Miss Rottenmeier, ringing the bell with all her might( 力气 ).

When the two servants arrived, they were hardly able to wake Heidi enough to show her to her bedroom.
<hr>
When Heidi opened her eyes next morning, she was eager( 渴望 ) to look at the sky and the ground below.

She had always done so at home.

She felt very disappointed( 失望的 ) when she found that the windows were too high for her to see anything except walls and windows.

The poor child felt like a little bird that was placed in a beautiful cage( 笼 ) for the first time.

Clara looked much happier than usual.

When breakfast had passed, the two children were allowed to go into the library together and were soon left alone.

“How can I see down to the ground?” Heidi asked.

“Open a window and look out,” replied Clara, amused( 发笑 ) at the question.

“But it is impossible to open them,” Heidi said, sadly.

“Oh no. You can’t do it and I can’t help you, either, but if you ask Sebastian he’ll do it for you.”

Heidi was relieved( 感到宽慰的 ).

The poor child had felt like a prisoner( 囚犯 ) in her room.

Clara now asked Heidi what her home had been like, and Heidi told her gladly about her life in the hut( 小屋 ).

In the afternoon, while Clara was resting, Heidi was left to herself.

She planted herself in the hall and waited for the butler( 男管家 ) to come upstairs( 上楼 ) with the silver tea-things.

When he reached the head of the stairs( 楼梯 ), she said to him,

“I want to ask you something.”

She saw that the butler seemed surprised, so she made him feel better by saying that she did not mean any harm.

“What can I do for you?” asked Sebastian.

“Can you open a window for me?”

“Certainly,” he replied.

Sebastian got a chair for Heidi, for the window was too high for her to see.

Heidi looked out of the window and in great disappointment turned her head away.

“I don’t see anything but a street of stone. Is it the same way on the other side of the house?”

“Yes.”

“Where do you go to look far down on everything?”

“On a church tower. Do you see that one over there with the golden top?

From there you can overlook( 俯瞰 ) everything.”

Heidi immediately stepped down from the chair and ran downstairs( 下楼 ).

Opening the door, she found herself in the street, but she could not see the tower anymore.

She wandered( 漫步 ) on from street to street, too afraid to ask any of the busy people where to go.

While she was wandering down the street, she found herself before an old church with a tower.

Heidi was puzzled( 感到疑惑的 ) what to do next, but having discovered a bell, she pulled it with all her might.

The lock made a sound from inside, and an old man opened the door.

In an angry voice, he said,

“Why do you ring for me? Can’t you see that it is only for those who want to see the tower?”

“But I do,” said Heidi.

“What do you want to see? Did anybody send you?” asked the man.

“No, but I want to look down from up there.”

“Get home and don’t try it again.”

With those words the tower-keeper was going to shut the door, but Heidi held his coattails( 燕尾服的燕尾 ) and asked him to let her come.

The tower-keeper looked at the child’s eyes, which were nearly full of tears( 眼泪 ).

“All right, come along, if you care so much,” he said, taking her by the hand.

The two climbed up many, many steps, which got narrower( 变窄 ) all the time.

When they had arrived on top, the old man lifted Heidi up to the open window.

Heidi saw nothing but a sea of chimneys( 烟囱 ), roofs( 屋顶 ) and towers, and her heart sank( 情绪低落 ).

“Oh, dear, it’s different from the way I thought it would be,” she said.

“There! What could such a little girl know about a view?

We’ll go down now and you must promise never to ring at my tower anymore.”

On their way downstairs they saw a large gray cat guarding her new family in a basket.

Heidi looked at her in surprise, and was delighted( 高兴的 ) when the old man opened the basket.

“What cute kittens( 小猫 ), what smart little creatures( 生物 )!” she shouted in her delight( 高兴 ),

when she saw them crawling( 爬 ) about, jumping and rolling( 翻 ).

“Would you like to have one?” the old man asked.

“For me? To keep? How can I take them with me?” Heidi asked, for she could not believe her ears.

“I can bring them to your house, if you tell me where you live,” said Heidi’s new friend.

How happy Heidi was! Clara would be delighted when she saw the cute things.

“Bring them to Mr. Sesemann’s house; there is a golden dog on the door, with a ring in his mouth.”

The old man had lived in the tower for a long time and knew everybody;

Sebastian also was a special friend of his.

“I know,” he said.

“But to whom shall I send them? Do you belong to( 属于 ) Mr. Sesemann?”

“No. Please send them to Clara; she will like them, I am sure.”

Heidi could hardly tear herself away( 舍不得离开 ) from the pretty things, so the old man put one kitten in each of her pockets to comfort her.

After that she went away.
<hr>
When she had taken leave of the tower-keeper, she asked a boy on the street,

“Do you know where Mr. Sesemann’s house is?”

“No,” was the reply.

She described it as well as she could, till the boy remembered it.

Off they started, and soon Heidi found herself pulling the doorbell( 门铃 ).

When Sebastian arrived he said, “Hurry up.”

Heidi went in, and the boy was left outside, for Sebastian had not even seen him.

“Come up quickly, little Miss,” he urged( 催促 ).

“They are all waiting for you in the dining room.

Miss Rottenmeier looks very angry. How could you run away like that?”

Heidi sat down quietly on her chair.

Nobody said a word, and there was an uncomfortable silence.

At last Miss Rottenmeier began with a severe( 严厉的 ) and solemn( 庄严的 ) voice:

“I shall speak with you later, Adelheid.

How can you leave the house without a word?

You acted very wrongly. The idea of walking about till so late!”

“Meow!” was the reply.

“I didn’t,” Heidi began—”Meow!”

“This is enough,” Miss Rottenmeier tried to say, but she could hardly speak because she was so angry.

“Get up and leave the room.”

Heidi got up. She began again.

“I made—” “Meow! Meow! Meow!—”

“Heidi,” said Clara now,

“why do you always say ‘meow’ again, if you see that Miss Rottenmeier is angry?”

“I am not doing it, it’s the kittens( 小猫 ),” she explained.

“What? Cats? Kittens?” screamed( 尖叫 ) the housekeeper( 管家 ).

“Sebastian, take the horrible( 糟糕的 ) things away!”

With that she ran into the study, locking herself in, for she feared cats beyond anything on earth.

When Sebastian had finished laughing, he came into the room.

He had foreseen( 预见 ) the scene, having caught sight of( 看见 ) the kittens when Heidi came in.

The scene was a very peaceful one now; Clara held the little kittens in her lap( 大腿 ), and Heidi was sitting beside her.

They both played happily with the two beautiful creatures( 生物 ).

The butler( 男管家 ) promised to look after the newcomers and prepared a bed for them in a basket.

A long time afterward( 之后 ), when it was time to go to bed, Miss Rottenmeier cautiously( 小心地 ) opened the door.

“Are they away?” she asked.

“Yes,” replied the butler, quickly seizing( 捉住 ) the kittens and taking them away.

Miss Rottenmeier wanted to tell Heidi off, but she waited until the following day, for the lady was too tired after her fright( 恐惧 ).

They all went quietly to bed, and the children were happy in the thought that their kittens had a comfortable bed.

A short time after the tutor( 家庭教师 ) had arrived next morning, there was a knock at the study door.

Sebastian appeared with a large basket, which had been brought for Clara.

“We had better have our lesson before we inspect( 检查 ) it,” said Miss Rottenmeier.

But Clara turned to the tutor and asked,

“Oh, please, Mr. Candidate, can’t we just look shortly, to see what it is?”

“I am afraid that you will think of nothing else,” the teacher began.

Just then something in the basket moved, and one, two, three and still more kittens jumped out.

They ran around the room with the utmost( 最快的 ) speed.

They bounded over the tutor’s boots( 靴子 ) and bit his trousers;

they climbed up on Miss Rottenmeier’s dress and crawled( 爬 ) around her feet.

Mewing and running, they caused a frightful( 可怕的 ) confusion( 混乱局面 ).

Clara called out in delight( 高兴地 ):

“Oh, look at the cute creatures; look how they jump!

Heidi, look at that one, and oh, see the one over there?”

Heidi followed them about, while the teacher shook them off.

When the housekeeper collected her wits( 恢复理智 ) after the great fright, she called for the servants.

They soon arrived and stored the little kittens safely in the new bed.

Miss Rottenmeier had found out who was responsible( 负有责任的 ).

When she was alone with the children in the evening, she began severely:

“Adelheid, there is only one punishment for you.

I am going to send you to the cellar( 地下室 ), to think about the terrible things you did, in company with the rats( 老鼠 ).”

A cellar held no terrors( 恐怖 ) for Heidi.

In her grandfather’s cellar, fresh milk and the good cheese( 奶酪 ) had been kept, and no rats had lived there.

But Clara shouted:

“Oh, Miss Rottenmeier, you must wait till Papa comes home, and then he can punish Heidi.”

The lady unwillingly replied:

“All right, Clara, but I shall also speak a few words to Mr. Sesemann.” With those words she left the room.

Since the child’s arrival everything had been upset( 令人心烦的 ), and the lady often felt discouraged( 灰心的 ), though nothing unusual happened for a few days.

Clara, on the contrary( 相反 ), enjoyed her companion’s society, for she always did funny things.

In her lesson she could never get her letters straight.

The girls always spent their evenings together, and Heidi would entertain( 使快乐 ) her friend with tales( 故事 ) of her former life.

In the end, Heidi’s longing always grew so great that she added:

“I have to go home now. I must go tomorrow.”

But Clara would say things to make Heidi feel better, and her promise of more rolls( 面包卷 ) for the grandmother made Heidi stay.
<hr>
Heidi really needed some clothes, so Clara had given her some.

When Miss Rottenmeier was just busy arranging( 整理 ) the child’s wardrobe( 衣橱 ), she suddenly returned to the study, where the two children stayed.

“Adelheid,” she said hatefully,

“What do I find? A big pile of( 一大堆 ) bread in your wardrobe! I never heard the like. Yes, Clara, it is true.”

Then she ordered to take away the bread and the old hat she had found.

“No, don’t! I must keep my hat! The bread is for grandmother,” cried Heidi in despair( 绝望地 ).

“You stay here, while we take the rubbish away,” said the lady decidedly.

Heidi threw herself down on Clara’s chair and sobbed( 啜泣 ) as if her heart would break.

“Now I can’t bring grandmother any rolls( 面包卷 )! Oh, they were for grandmother!” she cried sadly.

“Heidi, don’t cry anymore,” Clara begged( 乞求 ).

“Listen! When you go home someday( 某天 ), I am going to give you as many rolls as you had, and more.

They will be much softer and better than those ones you have kept.

Those were not fit to eat, Heidi. Stop now, please, and don’t cry anymore!”

At supper( 晚餐 ), Heidi’s eyes were swollen( 肿的 ) and it was still hard for her to keep from crying.

Sebastian made strange signs to her that she did not understand. What did he mean?

Later, though, when she climbed into her high bed, she found her old hat that she loved so much hidden under her cover.

So Sebastian had saved it for her and had tried to tell her!

She held it close to her and was very happy.

She hid it in the furthest corner of her wardrobe.

A few days afterward( 之后 ) there was great excitement in the Sesemann house, for the master( 主人 ) of the house had just arrived.

The servants were taking upstairs( 上楼 ) one load( 袋 ) after another, for Mr. Sesemann always brought many lovely things home with him.

When he entered his daughter’s room, Heidi shyly retreated into( 退到 ) a corner.

He greeted( 向...问好 ) Clara lovingly, and she was equally delighted( 高兴的 ) to see him, for she loved her father dearly.

In the dining room he found Miss Rottenmeier surveying the table with a most tragic( 悲惨的 ) face.

“You do not look very happy at my arrival, Miss Rottenmeier. What is the matter? Clara seems well enough,” he said to her.

“Oh, Mr. Sesemann, we have been terribly disappointed( 失望的 ),” said the lady.

“What do you mean?” asked Mr. Sesemann, drinking his wine calmly( 平静地 ).

“We had decided, as you know, to have a companion( 同伴 ) for Clara.

Knowing that you would wish me to get a noble( 贵族的 ), pure( 纯洁的 ) child, I thought of this Swiss( 瑞士的 ) child.

I have been terribly disappointed, for this child has brought the most frightful( 吓人的 ) animals into the house.

Mr. Candidate can tell you!”

“The child does not look very terrible. But what do you mean?”

“I cannot explain it, because she does not seem in her right mind at times.”

Mr. Sesemann was getting worried at last, and decided to talk to his daughter.

He found the children in the study.

Turning to Heidi, who had risen at his approach, he said,

“Come, little one, get me—get me a glass of water.”

“Fresh water?”

“Of course, fresh water,” he replied.

When Heidi had gone, he sat down near Clara, holding her hand.

“Tell me, little Clara,” he asked,

“please tell me clearly what animals Heidi has brought into the house;

is she really not right in her mind?”

Clara now began to relate to her father all the incidents( 事件 ) with the kittens( 小猫 ).

Mr. Sesemann laughed a lot and asked Clara if she wished Heidi to remain.

“Of course, Papa. Since she is here, something amusing( 好笑的 ) happens every day;

it used to be so dull( 无聊的 ), but now Heidi keeps me company.”

“Very good, very good, Clara; Oh! Here is your friend back again.

Did you get nice fresh water?” asked Mr. Sesemann.

Heidi handed him the glass and said,

“Yes, fresh from the fountain( 喷泉 ).”

“You did not go to the fountain yourself, Heidi?” said Clara.

“Certainly, but I had to get it from far, there were so many people at the first and at the second fountain.

I had to go down another street and there I got it.”

Clara’s father laughed.

In the evening, Mr. Sesemann told Miss Rottenmeier that Heidi was going to remain,

for the children were very fond of( 喜欢 ) each other and he found Heidi normal( 正常的 ) and very sweet.

“I want the child to be treated kindly,” Mr. Sesemann added decidedly.

“Her strange characteristics( 性格 ) must not be punished.

My mother is coming very soon to stay here, and she will help you to manage the child.

There is nobody in this world that my mother could not get along with, as you know, Miss Rottenmeier.”

“Of course, I know that, Mr. Sesemann,” replied the lady, but she was not very much pleased at the idea of Mrs. Sesemann coming over.

Mr. Sesemann only stayed two weeks, for his business called him back to Paris( 巴黎，地名 ).

He consoled( 安抚 ) his daughter by telling her that his mother was coming in a very few days.

Mr. Sesemann had hardly left, when the grandmother’s visit was announced( 宣告 ) for the following day.
<hr>
The following evening great expectation took hold of the house.

When the carriage at last drove up, the servants flew downstairs( 下楼 ), followed by Miss Rottenmeier in more measured( 谨慎小心的 ) step.

Heidi had been sent to her room to wait for further orders, but it was not long before she was ordered to go to the study.

The grandmama( 祖母 ), with her kind and loving way, immediately became friends with the child and made her feel as if she had known her always.

To the housekeeper’s great shame, the grandmama called the child Heidi, remarking( 说话 ) to Miss Rottenmeier:

“If somebody’s name is Heidi, I call her so.”

The housekeeper( 管家 ) soon found that she had to respect the grandmother’s ways and opinions.

Mrs. Sesemann always knew what was going on in the house the minute she entered it.

Clara was resting the following afternoon.

The old lady had shut her eyes for five minutes, when she got up again and went into the dining room, where Heidi was.

Miss Rottenmeier had told her that Heidi could not read, and she decided to look into the matter.

Instead of teaching Heidi to read, the grandmama showed her a large book with beautiful pictures.

Suddenly Heidi screamed( 尖叫 ) aloud, for there on the picture she saw a peaceful group of goats( 山羊 ) on a green pasture( 牧场 ).

In the middle a goatherd( 牧羊人 ) was standing.

The setting sun was shedding( 洒 ) a golden light over everything.

With glowing( 热情洋溢的 ) eyes Heidi took in the scene eagerly( 渴望地 ); but suddenly she began to sob( 啜泣 ) violently( 激烈地 ).

The grandmama took her little hand in hers and said in the most comforting voice,

“Come, child, you must not cry. Did this remind( 使记起 ) you of something?

Now stop, dry your tears( 眼泪 ) now, darling( 亲爱的 ), I must ask you something.”

Heidi did not stop at once, but the kind lady gave her enough time to calm( 使冷静 ) herself, saying from time to time,

“Now it’s all over. Now we’ll be merry( 欢乐的 ) again.”

When the child was quiet at last, she said,

“Tell me now how your lessons are going. What have you learnt, child, tell me?”

“Nothing,” Heidi sighed( 叹息 );

“but I knew that I never could learn it.”

“I am going to tell you something, Heidi,” said the kind lady.

“I expect that you will learn it in a very short time, as a great many other children do.

When you can read, I am going to give you this book.

You have seen the shepherd( 牧羊人 ) on the green pasture.

You’ll be able to find out all the strange things that happen to him.

Yes, you can hear the whole story, and what he does with his goats.

You would like to know, wouldn’t you, Heidi?”

Heidi had listened with great attention, and said with shining eyes,

“If only I could read already!”

“It won’t be long, I can see that. Come now and let us go to Clara.” With that they both went over to the study.

Even though Heidi enjoyed spending time with her new friends, she longed to see the mountains again.

Only in her dreams she would be happy.

When she woke up in the morning, she always found herself on her high white bed, far away from home.

Burying( 埋 ) her head in her pillow( 枕头 ), she would often weep( 哭泣 ) a long, long time.

Mrs. Sesemann had noticed the child’s unhappiness, but she let a few days pass by, hoping for a change.

But the change never came, and often Heidi’s eyes were red even in the early morning.

So she called the child to her room one day.

With great sympathy( 同情 ) in her voice she said,

“Tell me, Heidi, what is the matter with you? What is making you so sad?”

But as Heidi did not want to appear thankless, she replied sadly:

“I can't tell you.”

“No? Can’t you tell Clara perhaps?”

“Oh, no, I can’t tell anyone,” Heidi said, looking so unhappy that the old lady’s heart was filled with pity.

“I tell you something, little girl,” she continued.

“If you have a sorrow( 伤心事 ) that you cannot tell anyone, you can go to Our Father in Heaven( 天堂 ).

Have you ever prayed( 祈祷 ), Heidi? Do you know what I mean?”

“I only prayed with my first grandmother, but it is so long ago, that I have forgotten.”

“See, Heidi, I understand now why you are so unhappy.

We all need somebody to help us.

We can tell the Lord everything and ask Him to comfort us, when nobody else can do it.

He can give us happiness.”

“Can we tell Him everything, everything?”

“Yes, Heidi, everything.”

The child said hurriedly,

“Can I go to pray now?”

“Yes, of course,” was the reply, and with this Heidi ran to her room.

Sitting down on a chair, she folded( 交叠 ) her hands and poured( 倾泻 ) out her heart to God, asking Him to help her and let her go home to her grandfather.
<hr>
About a week later, Mr. Candidate asked to see Mrs. Sesemann, to tell her of something unusual that had occurred( 发生 ).

With many more words the happy grandmama was told that Heidi had suddenly learned to read.

She read with the utmost( 最大的 ) correctness, most rare( 稀罕的 ) with beginners.

“Many strange things happen in this world,” Mrs. Sesemann remarked( 说 ),

while they went over to the study to witness( 见证 ) Heidi’s new achievement.

Heidi was sitting close to Clara, reading her a story;

Heidi seemed amazed( 吃惊的 ) at the strange, new world that had opened up before her.

At supper( 晚餐 ), Heidi found the large book with the beautiful pictures on her plate( 盘子 ).

Looking doubtfully at grandmama, she saw the old lady nod.

“Now it belongs to( 属于 ) you, Heidi,” she said.

“Forever( 永远 )? Also when I am going home?” Heidi asked, confused( 疑惑的 ) with joy( 欢乐 ).

“Certainly, forever!” the grandmama told her. “Tomorrow we shall begin to read it.”

Heidi still looked at her book before going to bed that night, and this book became her dearest treasure.

She would look at the beautiful pictures and read all the stories aloud to Clara.

Since Heidi had learned to read and possessed( 拥有 ) the book, the days seemed to fly.

The time had come near that the grandmama would leave.

The grandmama sent for Heidi every day after dinner, while Clara was resting and Miss Rottenmeier disappeared into her room.

Often Heidi would read to the old lady, for the more often she read over the stories, the dearer they became to her.

But she never looked really cheerful and her eyes never shone happily as before.

The day of departure( 离开 ) had come, but Mrs. Sesemann arranged( 整理 ) everything in such a way that the children hardly realized she was actually( 真正地 ) going.

Everything was empty and quiet when she had gone, and the children hardly knew how to pass their time.

Next day, Heidi came to Clara and read some story to her.

But she did not get very far, for the story she was reading told of a grandmother’s death.

Suddenly she cried aloud:

“Oh, now grandmother is dead!”

It seemed so real to her that she thought it was her own grandmother at home.

Louder and louder she cried:

“Now poor grandmother is dead and I can never see her anymore; and she never got one single roll( 面包卷 )!”

Miss Rottenmeier had overheard( 偶然听到 ) the scene.

She came to Heidi and said impatiently( 不耐烦地 ):

“Adelheid, now you have screamed( 大声喊叫 ) enough.

If I hear you again crying in such a noisy way, I shall take your book away forever!”

Heidi turned pale at that, for the book was her greatest treasure.

Quickly drying her tears( 眼泪 ), she stopped crying. After that Heidi never cried again in front of the housekeeper( 管家 ).

But she got more cheerless every day, and looked so thin and pale.

In the evening she would cry quietly, with her heart bursting with( 充满 ) longing to go home.

Thus the time passed by.

Heidi struggled( 挣扎 ) constantly( 不断地 ) against her sorrow( 伤心 ), but in vain( 徒劳 ).

Autumn and winter had passed, and Heidi knew that the time was coming when Peter would go up the Alp with his goats.

The flowers were shining in the sunshine and the mountains were all on fire.

She would sit down in a corner of her room and put both hands before her eyes.

In this way, she tried not to see the sunshine on the opposite( 相反的 ) wall.

There she would remain, filled with longing, till Clara would call for her to come.

Something strange was happening in the house.

Every morning, when the servants came downstairs( 下楼 ), they found the front door wide open.

At first everybody had thought that the house must have been robbed( 遭窃 ), but nothing was missing.

Every morning it was the same, despite the double locks that were put on the door.

At last Sebastian and one of the other servants prepared themselves to watch through a night to see who the ghost( 鬼 ) was.

They went to a room downstairs, where they first talked, but soon, getting sleepy, they rested silently in their chairs.

When the clock from the old church tower struck one, Sebastian awoke and awakened his friend, which was no easy matter.

At last, however, the servant was wide awake, and together they went out into the hall.

The same moment a strong wind put out the light that the servant held in his hand.

Rushing back, he nearly walked into Sebastian, who stood behind him.

Pulling the butler( 男管家 ) back into the room, he locked the door quickly.

When the light was lit again, Sebastian noticed that the servant was deadly pale and trembling( 摇晃 ) like a leaf.

Sebastian, not having seen anything, asked anxiously( 焦急地 ),

“What is the matter? What did you see?”

“The door was open and a white form was on the stairs( 楼梯 ); it went up and was gone in a moment,”

said the servant breathlessly( 气喘吁吁地 ).

Cold shivers( 冷颤 ) ran down Sebastian’s back.

They sat without moving till the morning came, and then, shutting( 关 ) the door,

They went upstairs( 上楼 ) to report to Miss Rottenmeier what they had seen.
<hr>
The lady, who was waiting eagerly( 急切地 ), heard the tale( 故事 ) and immediately sat down to write to Mr. Sesemann.

Mr. Sesemann arrived shortly after. Going to his daughter’s room after his arrival, he was very happy to see her as well as ever.

“What new tricks( 把戏 ) has the ghost( 鬼 ) played on you, Miss Rottenmeier?” asked Mr. Sesemann with a twinkle( 闪光 ) in his eye.

“It is no joke, Mr. Sesemann,” replied the lady seriously.

“I am sure you will not laugh tomorrow.”

Mr. Sesemann decided to figure out what happened at night himself.

He called his friend, a doctor, who arrived exactly at nine o’clock.

Mr. Sesemann explained to the doctor that a ghost was coming to the house every night.

He said that the matter was probably a bad joke that a friend of the servants was playing in his absence.

It could also be that somebody was trying to break into the house to steal something.

With these explanations, they entered the room where the two servants had watched before.

They left the door only partly open, for too much light might drive the ghost away.

Then, sitting down comfortably, the two men passed their time by chatting( 聊天 ) and drinking every now and then.

They talked till one o’clock.

Everything was quiet, and not a sound came from the street. Suddenly the doctor raised his finger.

“Sh! Sesemann, don’t you hear something?”

While they both listened, the key was turned, and the door flew open.

On the other side stood a motionless( 静止的 ) white form, lighted up by the moon.

“Who is there?” thundered( 怒吼 ) the doctor, approaching the figure.

It turned and screamed( 尖叫 ).

There stood Heidi, with bare( 赤裸的 ) feet and in her white nightgown( 睡衣 ), looking confused( 疑惑的 ) at the bright light.

She was shaking with fear, while the two men were looking at her in amazement( 惊愕 ).

“Child, what does this mean?” asked Mr. Sesemann.

“What did you want to do? Why have you come down here?”

Pale from fright( 恐惧 ), Heidi said,

“I don't know.”

The doctor came forward now.

“Sesemann, this case belongs to( 属于 ) my field. Please go and sit down while I take her to bed.”

He led the trembling( 哆嗦的 ) child upstairs( 上楼 ).

“Don’t be afraid; just be quiet! Everything is all right; don’t be frightened( 感到害怕的 ).”

When they had arrived in Heidi’s room, the doctor put the little girl to bed, covering her up carefully.

Drawing a chair near her, he waited till Heidi had calmed down( 冷静下来 ) and had stopped trembling.

Then taking her hand in his, he said kindly,

“Now everything is all right again. Tell me where you wanted to go?”

“I did not want to go anywhere,” Heidi told him;

“I did not go myself, only I was there all of a sudden.”

“Really! Tell me, what did you dream?”

“Oh, I have the same dream every night.

I always think I am with my grandfather again and can hear the fir( 冷杉 ) trees roar( 咆哮 ).

I always think how beautiful the stars must be, and then I open the door of the hut( 小屋 ), and oh, it is so wonderful!

But when I wake up I am always in Frankfurt.”

“Does your back or your head hurt you, child?”

“No, but I feel as if a big stone was pressing me here.”

“As if you had eaten something that disagreed with( 使…身体不适 ) you?”

“Oh no, but as if I wanted to cry hard.”

“So, and then you cry out, don’t you?”

“Oh no, I must never do that, for Miss Rottenmeier has forbidden( 禁止 ) it.”

“Then you swallow it down( 吞下 )? Yes? Do you like to be here?”

“Oh yes,” was the quiet, uncertain reply.

“Where did you live with your grandfather?”

“Up on the Alp.”

“But wasn’t it a little lonely there?”

“Oh no, it was so beautiful!” But Heidi could say no more.

Thinking about the Alp, all the restrained( 抑制的 ) sorrow( 伤心 ) overpowered( 压倒 ) the child.

The tears( 眼泪 ) rushed violently( 猛烈地 ) from her eyes and she broke out into loud sobs( 啜泣 ).

The doctor rose and comforted her.

He said,

“It won’t hurt to cry; you’ll go to sleep afterward( 之后 ), and when you wake up everything will come right.”

Then he left the room.

Joining his anxious( 焦虑的 ) friend downstairs( 下楼 ), he said,

“Sesemann, the little girl is a sleepwalker( 梦游病者 ), and has accidentally( 偶然地 ) scared( 使惊吓 ) your whole household( 家人 ).

Besides, she is so homesick( 思乡的 ) that her little body has wasted away( 逐渐消瘦 ).

We shall have to act quickly.

The only solution for her is to be brought back to the mountain air where she came from.

She must go tomorrow.”

When Mr. Sesemann heard this, he said,

“If that is your advice, we must act at once; this is the only way then.”

When everything was settled( 处理好 ), the doctor took his leave, for the morning had already come and the sun was shining in through the door.

Mr. Sesemann, going upstairs in great anxiety( 处于焦虑中 ), knocked at the housekeeper’s door.

He asked her to hurry, for preparations for a journey had to be made.

Miss Rottenmeier was instructed to quickly pack( 打包 ) a trunk( 旅行箱 ) for Heidi.

Clara had been wakened by the unusual noises and was listening eagerly.

Her father told her of what had happened and how the doctor had ordered Heidi back to her home,

because her condition was serious and might get worse.

She might even climb the roof( 屋顶 ), or be exposed( 被暴露在 ) to similar dangers, if she was not cured( 被治愈 ) at once.
<hr>
Clara was painfully surprised and tried to prevent( 防止 ) her father from carrying out his plan.

He remained firm, however, promising to take her to Switzerland( 瑞士，地名 ) himself the following summer, if she was good and sensible( 理智的 ) now.

So the child gave up and begged( 乞求 ) to have Heidi’s trunk( 旅行箱 ) prepared in her room.

Mr. Sesemann encouraged her to get together good clothes to wear for her little friend.

Sebastian was told to get ready for travelling with the child.

He was to go to Basle that day and spend the night at a good hotel which his master( 主人 ) named.

The next day the child was to be brought to her home.

Heidi was dressed in her Sunday dress( 某人最好的衣服 ) and stood waiting for further orders

Mr. Sesemann called her now.

“Good morning, Mr. Sesemann,” Heidi said when she entered.

“What do you think about it, little one?” he asked her.

Heidi looked up to him in confusion( 疑惑地 ).

“You don’t seem to know anything about it,” laughed Mr. Sesemann,

“You are going home today.”

“Home?” Heidi repeated in a low voice.

Her surprise was so great that she opened her mouth in disbelief.

It seemed to her as if it was only a dream.

“Go to Clara, Heidi, till the carriage comes,” Mr. Sesemann said kindly.

Heidi had been wishing to go, and now she ran to Clara’s room, where a huge trunk was standing.

“Heidi, look at the things I had packed for you. Do you like them?” Clara asked.

There were a great many lovely things in it, but Heidi jumped for joy( 欢乐 ) when she discovered a little basket.

In it there were twelve round white rolls( 面包卷 ) for the grandmother.

The grandmama’s book was carefully packed, and so was the red scarf that Miss Rottenmeier had purposely left behind when she packed for Heidi.

Then putting on her pretty hat, she left her room to say goodbye to Clara.

She thanked Mr. Sesemann for all his goodness.

She also sent a message of thanks to the good old doctor, whom she believed to be the real cause of her going.

Only when Heidi was sitting in the train did she become aware of where she was going.

She knew now that she would really see her grandfather and the grandmother again, also Peter and the goats.

Her only fear was that the poor blind grandmother might have died while she was away.

The thing she looked forward to most was giving the soft white rolls to the grandmother.

While she was thinking about all these things, she fell asleep.

In Basle( 巴赛尔，地名 ) she was awoken by Sebastian, for they were to spend the night there.

The next morning they started off again, and it took them many hours before they reached Mayenfeld.

When they arrived at the station, Sebastian wished he could have travelled further in the train.

He didn’t want to climb a mountain.

The last part of the trip might be dangerous, for everything seemed half-wild in this country.

When he told Heidi this, she said,

“I can go up alone from the village. I know the road.”

Sebastian felt relieved( 放松的 ).

He asked a man to take Heidi’s trunk to the village so that the grandfather could pick it up the next day.

Then, calling Heidi to him, he presented her with a heavy roll of bills and a letter for the grandfather.

These important things were put at the bottom of the basket, under the rolls, so that they could not possibly get lost.

Heidi promised to be careful of them.

The two old friends shook hands and parted.

Heidi began to tremble( 颤抖 ) with excitement when she recognized( 认出 ) all the trees she knew on the road and the peaks( 山顶 ) of the mountains.

She was running up the path( 小路 ); from time to time she had to stop, for her basket was heavy and she lost her breath( 喘不过气 ).

Her one idea was:

“If only grandmother still sits in her corner by her spinning( 旋转的 ) wheel!

Oh, if she should have died!”

When the child caught sight of the hut at last, her heart began to beat.

The quicker she ran, the more it beat, but at last she tremblingly opened the door.

“Here I am! Grandmother, here I am!” shouted the child,

running into the middle of the room and throwing herself on her knees before the old woman.

The grandmother seized( 抓住 ) Heidi’s hands and pulled her close.

She was so happy and so surprised that she could only silently touch the child’s curly( 卷的 ) hair over and over again.

“Yes, yes,” she said at last,

“this is Heidi’s hair, and her lovely voice.”

Out of her blind eyes big tears( 眼泪 ) of joy( 快乐 ) fell down on Heidi’s hand.

“Is it really you, Heidi? Have you really come again?”

“Yes, yes, grandmother,” the child replied.

“You must not cry, for I have come and will never leave you anymore.

Now you won’t have to eat hard black bread anymore for a little while.

Look what I have brought you.”

Heidi put one roll after another on the grandmother’s lap( 大腿 ).

“Ah, child, what a blessing( 福气 ) you bring to me!” the old woman cried.

“But you are my greatest blessing yourself, Heidi!”

Then, touching the child’s hair and red cheeks( 脸颊 ), she said,

“Just say one more word, so that I may hear your voice.”
<hr>
While Heidi was talking, Peter’s mother arrived, and shouted out in her amazement( 惊讶地 ):

“Surely, this is Heidi. But how can that be?”

The child rose to shake hands with Brigida, who could not get over Heidi’s beautiful dress and hat.

“You can have my hat, I don’t want it anymore; I have my old one still,” Heidi said, pulling out her old straw( 稻草 ) hat.

Heidi had remembered her grandfather’s words to Deta about her feather( 羽毛 ) hat;

that was why she had kept her old hat so carefully.

Brigida at last accepted the gift after objecting a great many times.

Suddenly Heidi took off her pretty dress and tied her old scarf about her.

Taking the grandmother’s hand, she said,

“Goodbye, I must go home to grandfather now, but I shall come again tomorrow. Good night, grandmother.”

“Oh, please come again tomorrow, Heidi,” said the old woman, while she held her fast( 紧紧拉住 ).

As Heidi climbed further up the mountain, she looked back and saw a scene so beautiful

as she had not even seen anything like it in her most vivid( 生动的 ) dream.

The rocky peaks( 山顶 ) were flaming( 火红的 ) in the bright light, the snow fields glowed( 发光 ) and soft clouds were floating( 漂浮 ) overhead( 在头上 ).

The child stood still, and in her joy( 欢乐 ) tears( 眼泪 ) ran down her cheeks( 脸颊 ).

Only when the glow had gone away was Heidi able to follow the path( 小路 ) again.

She climbed so fast that she could soon discover, first the treetops( 树梢 ), then the roof( 屋顶 ), finally the hut( 小屋 ).

Now she could see her grandfather sitting on his bench( 长凳 ), smoking a pipe( 烟卷 ).

Above the cottage( 乡间小屋 ) the fir( 冷杉 ) trees gently swung( 摇摆 ) in the soft evening wind.

At last she had reached the hut, and throwing herself in her grandfather’s arms, she hugged( 拥抱 ) him and held him tight( 紧紧地 ).

She could say nothing but “Grandfather! Grandfather! Grandfather!” in her excitement.

The old man said nothing either, but his eyes were wet.

Letting go of Heidi’s arms at last, he sat her on his knee.

When he had looked at her for a while, he said,

“So you have come home again, Heidi? Why? You certainly do not look very cityfied( 都市风的 )! Did they send you away?”

“Oh no, you must not think that, grandfather.

They all were so good to me; Clara, Mr. Sesemann and grandmama( 祖母 ).

But grandfather, sometimes I felt as if I could not bear it any longer to be away from you!

I thought I could not breathe( 呼吸 );

I could not tell anyone, for that would have been ungrateful( 忘恩负义的 ).

Suddenly, one morning Mr. Sesemann called me very early, I think it was the doctor’s doing and—

but I think it is probably written in this letter;”

with that Heidi brought the letter and the bankroll( 钱 ) from her basket, putting them on her grandfather’s lap( 大腿 ).

“This belongs to( 属于 ) you,” he said, laying the roll beside him.

Having read the letter, he put it in his pocket.

“Do you think you can still drink milk with me, Heidi?” he asked, while he stepped into the cottage.

“Take your money with you, you can buy a bed with it and clothes for many years.”

“I don’t need it at all, grandfather,” Heidi assured( 使确信 ) him;

“I have a bed and Clara has given me so many dresses that I shan’t need anymore all my life.”

“Take it and put it in the cupboard( 衣橱 ), for you will need it someday( 某天 ).”

Heidi obeyed( 听从 ), and danced around the hut in her delight( 高兴 ) to see all the things she had missed so much again.

Running up to the loft( 阁楼 ), she exclaimed( 大声叫喊 ) in great disappointment( 失望 ):

“Oh grandfather, my bed is gone.”

“It will come again,” the grandfather called up from below;

“how could I know that you were coming back? Get your milk now!”

When the grandfather came with the milk, Heidi took her old seat.

She seized( 拿起 ) her bowl and emptied it eagerly( 急切地 ), as if it was the most wonderful thing she had ever tasted.

“Grandfather, our milk is the best in all the world.”

Suddenly Heidi, hearing a high whistle( 哨声 ), rushed outside, as Peter and all his goats( 山羊 ) came racing down.

Heidi greeted( 问候 ) the boy, who stopped, rooted to the spot( 呆住不动 ), staring( 盯 ) at her.

Then she ran into the middle of her friends, who had not forgotten her either.

Schwänli and Bärli cried for joy, and all her other favorites pressed near to her.

Heidi was beside herself with joy, and touched little Snowhopper and Thistlefinch, till she felt herself pushed to and fro among them.

“Peter, why don’t you come down and say good night to me?” Heidi called to the boy.

“Have you come again?” he said at last.

Then he took Heidi’s hand and asked her, as if she had been always there:

“Are you coming up with me tomorrow?”

“No, tomorrow I must go to see grandmother, but perhaps the day after.”

Peter had a hard time with his goats that night, for they would not follow him.

Over and over again they came back to Heidi, till she entered the shed( 棚 ) with Bärli and Schwänli and shut the door.

When Heidi went up to her loft to sleep, she found a fresh, fragrant( 芳香的 ) bed waiting for her;

and she slept better that night than she had for many, many months, for her great and burning longing( 渴望 ) had been satisfied.

About ten times that night the grandfather rose to listen to Heidi’s quiet breathing.

Heidi slept quietly, for she had seen the flaming mountains and had heard the fir trees roar( 咆哮 ).
<hr>
Heidi was standing under the swaying( 摇摆的 ) fir( 冷杉 ) trees, waiting for her grandfather to join her.

He had promised to bring up her trunk( 旅行箱 ) from the village while she went to visit the grandmother.

The child was longing to see the blind woman again and to hear how she had liked the rolls( 面包卷 ).

When they had went down and Heidi entered Peter’s hut( 小屋 ), the grandmother called lovingly to her:

“Have you come again, child?”

She took hold of Heidi’s hand and held it tight( 紧紧地 ).

Grandmother then told the little visitor how good the rolls had tasted, and how much stronger she felt already.

Brigida related further that the grandmother had only eaten a single roll, being so afraid to finish them too soon.

Heidi had listened with great attention, and said now:

“Oh, grandmother, I have an awful lot of money. Now I know what I’ll do with it.

Every day you must have a fresh roll and two on Sundays.

Peter can bring them up from the village.”

“No, no, child,” the grandmother said.

“That must not be. You must give it to grandfather and he’ll tell you what to do with it.”

But Heidi did not listen.

She jumped happily about the little room, calling over and over again,

“Maybe your eyes will see again, too, when you are strong and well.”

The grandmother remained silent, not to spoil( 破坏 ) the child’s happiness.

Seeing the old song book on the shelf( 架子 ), Heidi said:

“Grandmother, shall I read you a song from your book now? I can read quite nicely!”

“Oh yes, I wish you would, child. Can you really read?”

Heidi climbed on a chair and took down the dusty( 沾满灰尘的 ) old book.

After she had carefully cleaned it, she sat down on a chair.

“What shall I read, grandmother?”

“Whatever you want to,” was the reply.

Turning the pages, Heidi found a song about the sun, and decided to read that aloud.

An expression of indescribable happiness shone in the grandmother’s face, though tears( 眼泪 ) were rolling( 滚 ) down her cheeks( 脸颊 ).

When Heidi had repeated the end of the song a number of times, the old woman shouted out:

“Oh, Heidi, everything seems bright to me again and my heart is light.

Thank you, child, you have done me so much good.”

Soon the grandfather knocked on the window, for it was time to go.

Heidi told the grandfather she planned to buy rolls for the grandmother every day, and he agreed.

At this the child jumped, shouting:

“Oh grandfather, now grandmother won’t ever have to eat hard, black bread anymore.

Oh, everything is so wonderful now!

Grandmama told me that God would make everything much better than I could ever dream.

We’ll pray( 祈祷 ) every day, grandfather, won’t we? Otherwise, God might forget us.”

“And if somebody should forget to do it?” murmured( 咕哝 ) the old man.

“Oh, he’ll get on badly, for God will forget him, too.”

After a pause( 停顿 ) the grandfather said:

“Yes, but if it has happened, then there is no help; nobody can come back to the Lord, when God has once forgotten him.”

“But grandfather, everybody can come back to Him; grandmama( 祖母 ) told me that.

Do you know the story of the prodigal( 浪子回头的 ) son? I shall tell you as soon as we get home.”

When they arrived at the hut, Heidi began to tell the famous story to the grandfather, who sat silently beside her.

“Isn’t it a beautiful story, grandfather?” asked Heidi when she finished.

“Yes, Heidi, it is,” said the grandfather.

A few hours later, when Heidi was sleeping soundly( 酣睡地 ), the old man climbed up the ladder( 阶梯 ).

Placing a little lamp( 灯 ) beside the sleeping child, he watched her a long, long time.

Her little hands were folded( 交叠 ) and her red face looked confident( 自信的 ) and peaceful.

The old man now folded his hands. Big tears rolled down his cheeks.

He said in a low voice:

“Father, I have done wrong against Heaven( 天堂 ) and You, and am no more worthy to be Your son!”

The next morning found the uncle standing before the door, looking over valley( 山谷 ) and mountain.

A few early bells sounded from below and the birds sang their morning songs.

Entering the house again, he called:

“Heidi, get up! The sun is shining! Put on a pretty dress, for we are going to church!”

That was a new call, and Heidi obeyed( 听从 ) quickly.

When the child came downstairs( 下楼 ) in her smart( 漂亮的 ) little dress, she opened her eyes wide.

“Oh, grandfather!” she shouted,

“I have never seen you in your Sunday coat with the silver buttons( 纽扣 ). Oh, how fine you look!”

The old man, turning to the child, said with a smile,

“You look nice, too; come now!”

When they entered the church, all the people were singing.

Though they sat down on the last bench( 长凳 ) behind, the people had noticed their presence and whispered( 低声说 ) it from ear to ear.

After the service the old man and the child walked together to the churchman’s home.

He opened the door and received them with friendly words.

“I have come to ask you to forgive( 原谅 ) me for my harsh( 难听的 ) words,” said the uncle.

“I want to follow your advice to spend the winter here among you.

If the people look at me and they don’t trust me, I can’t expect any better.

I am sure you will trust me.”
<hr>
The churchman’s friendly eyes shone, and with many a kind word he praised the uncle for this change.

Putting his hand on Heidi’s curly( 卷卷的 ) hair, he led them out.

Thus the people, who had been all talking together about this great event, could see that their churchman shook hands with the old man.

They seemed very happy at the old man’s change; some of the people even accompanied( 陪伴 ) him when he walked home.

When they had parted at last, the uncle looked after them with his face shining as if there was a light coming from it.

Heidi looked up to him and said,

“Grandfather, you have never looked so beautiful!”

“Do you think so, child?” he said with a smile.

“You see, Heidi, I am more happy than I deserve( 应得 ). God has been good to me, to send you back.”

When they arrived at Peter’s hut, the grandfather opened the door and entered.

“How do you do, grandmother,” he called out.

“I think we must start to mend( 修补 ) again, before the fall wind comes.”

“Oh my God, the uncle!” shouted the grandmother in joyous( 快乐的 ) surprise.

“How happy I am to be able to thank you for what you have done, uncle! Thank you, God bless( 保佑 ) you for it.”

The next moment Peter arrived.

He had a letter for Heidi, which had been given to him in the village.

What an event, a letter for Heidi!

They all sat down at the table while the child read it aloud.

The letter was from Clara Sesemann, who wrote that everything had got so dull( 无聊的 ) since Heidi left.

She said that she could not stand it very long,

and therefore her father had promised to take her to the baths( 泡澡 ) at Ragatz this coming fall, which was not far from the Alp.

She announced( 宣告 ) that Grandmama was coming too, for she wanted to see Heidi and her grandfather.

Grandmama, having heard about the rolls( 面包卷 ), was sending some coffee, too, so that the grandmother would not have to eat them dry.

Grandmama also insisted( 坚持 ) on being taken to the grandmother herself when she came on her visit.

Everyone was very excited to hear that news!

While Heidi and her grandfather went home, they heard the peaceful sound of evening bells.

At last they reached their cottage( 乡间小屋 ), which seemed to glow( 发光 ) in the evening light.

The kind doctor, who had sent Heidi home to her beloved( 心爱的 ) mountains, was approaching the Sesemann house.

It was a sunny day in September.

His face was sad and his hair had turned very gray since spring.

A few months ago, the doctor had lost his only daughter, who had lived with him since his wife’s early death.

“I am glad you have come, doctor,” Mr. Sesemann called to his friend as he entered.

“Please let us talk over this trip to Switzerland( 瑞士，地名 ) again.

Do you still think that Clara should not go up the Alp?”

“She is too ill to go,” was the doctor’s answer.

Mr. Sesemann had gotten up and was walking round the room, as he always did when something was in his mind.

Suddenly he stood before his friend and said,

“Doctor, I have an idea. I cannot see you sad any longer.

You must get away. You shall go on this trip and visit Heidi instead.”

When Mr. Sesemann told Clara she couldn’t visit Heidi yet, her eyes filled with tears( 眼泪 ).

But she knew that her father did not like to see her cry.

Besides, she was sure that her father would only forbid( 禁止 ) her from this pleasure because it was necessary to do so.

So she bravely fought her tears, and holding the doctor’s hand, said:

“Oh please, doctor, do go to see Heidi; then you can tell me all about her.

Describe her grandfather to me, and Peter, with his goats.

I seem to know them all so well.

Then you can take all the things to her that I had planned to take myself.”

The doctor answered with a smile:

“Then I surely must go, Clara. You will get fat and strong, as we both want to see.

Have you decided yet when I must go?”

“Oh, you had better go tomorrow morning, doctor,” Clara urged( 催促 ).

Clara gave many messages to him for Heidi.

She also told him to be sure to observe( 观察 ) everything closely.

She wanted him to tell her all about it when he came back.

The doctor promised to satisfy all Clara’s wishes and to start the following day.

Clara asked Miss Rottenmeier to pack( 打包 ) some presents.

First came a heavy coat for Heidi, which Clara wanted her to use on visits to the grandmother in the winter.

Then came a thick warm scarf and a large box with coffee cake for the grandmother.

An enormous( 巨大的 ) sausage( 香肠 ) for Peter’s mother followed, and a little sack of( 一小麻袋 ) tobacco( 烟草 ) for the grandfather.

At last a lot of mysterious( 神秘的 ) little parcels( 包裹 ) and boxes were packed, with things that Clara had gathered( 收集 ) together for Heidi.

When the tidy pack lay ready on the ground, Clara’s heart filled with pleasure at the thought of her little friend’s delight( 高兴 ).
<hr>
It was an early morning in the mountains and a fresh wind rocked the old fir( 冷杉 ) trees to and fro.

Heidi opened her eyes, for the sound of the wind had awakened her.

Coming down the little ladder( 阶梯 ) and finding the grandfather’s bed empty, she ran outside.

The old man was looking up at the sky to see what the weather was going to be like that day.

Rosy clouds were passing overhead( 在头顶上 ), but gradually( 渐渐地 ) the sky grew more blue and deep.

Soon a golden light passed over the heights, for the sun was rising.

After the old man had washed and milked the goats( 山羊 ), he brought them out of the shed( 棚子 ).

When Heidi saw her friends again, she touched them tenderly( 温柔地 ).

Soon Peter arrived with the other goats, with the happy Thistlefinch ahead of all the others.

Heidi was soon in the middle of them, and was pushed about among them.

Peter was anxious( 心急地 ) to say a word to the little girl, so he gave a high whistle( 哨声 ), urging( 催促 ) the goats to climb ahead.

When he was near her, he said,

“You really might come with me today!”

“No, I can’t, Peter,” said Heidi.

“They might come from Frankfurt at any time. I must be home when they come.”

“How often you have said that,” said the boy with anger in his voice.

Then he turned about and led his goats up the mountain.

Since Heidi had come home again to her grandfather, she did many things that never occurred to( 想起 ) her before.

For instance, she would make her bed every morning, and run about the hut, tidying and cleaning.

After breakfast, Heidi began the task she had given to herself.

On this day it took her longer than usual, for the weather was too glorious( 美好的 ) to stay inside.

Over and over again the bright sun would tempt( 引诱 ) the busy child outside.

The grandfather had been busy in his little workshop( 工作间 ), merely glancing( 看一眼 ) over at the child from time to time.

Suddenly he heard her call:

“Oh grandfather, come!”

He was frightened( 感到害怕的 ) and came out quickly.

He saw her running down the hill crying:

“They are coming, they are coming. Oh, the doctor is coming first.”

When Heidi at last reached her old friend, he held out his hand, which Heidi immediately seized( 抓住 ).

In the full joy( 欢乐 ) of her heart, she shouted out:

“How do you do, doctor? And I thank you a thousand times!”

“How are you, Heidi? But what are you thanking me for?” the doctor asked, with a smile.

“Because you let me come home again,” the child explained.

The gentleman’s face lit up like sunshine.

He had certainly not expected to be received in that way on the Alp.

On the contrary( 相反 )!

Not even noticing all the beauty around him, he had climbed up sadly,

for he was sure that Heidi probably would not know him anymore.

Instead, he saw Heidi’s bright eyes looking up at him in gratefulness( 感激 ) and love.

“Come now, Heidi! Take me to your grandfather, for I want to see where you live.”

He had taken her hand like a kind father, but Heidi stood still and looked down the mountain side.

“But where are Clara and grandmama?” she asked.

“Child, I must tell you something now which will make you sad, and it makes me just as sad,” replied the doctor.

“I had to come alone, for Clara has been very ill and could not travel.

Of course grandmama has not come either;

but the spring will soon be here, and when the days get long and warm, they will surely visit you.”

Heidi was perfectly amazed( 惊讶的 ).

She could not understand how all those things that she had pictured to herself so clearly would not happen after all.

It was some time before Heidi remembered that, after all, she had come down to meet the doctor.

Looking up at her friend, she was struck by his sad and cheerless face.

How changed he was since she had seen him!

She did not like to see people unhappy, especially the good, kind doctor.

He must be sad because Clara and grandmama had not come.

To make him feel better, she said,

“Oh, it won’t last long till spring comes again; then they will come for sure;

they’ll be able to stay much longer then, and that will please Clara.

Now we’ll go to grandfather.”

Hand in hand they walked together to the cottage( 乡间小屋 ).

When they reached it, she called out to her grandfather quite happily:

“They are not here yet, but it won’t be very long before they are coming!”

The grandfather warmly welcomed his guest.

They all sat down on the bench( 长凳 ) before the door, and the doctor told them the reason of his visit.

He whispered( 低声说 ) to the child that something was coming up the mountain very soon which would bring her more pleasure than his visit.

What could it be?

The uncle advised the doctor to spend the splendid( 美妙的 ) days of autumn on the Alp.

He suggested that the doctor would take a little room in the village instead of in Ragatz.

From there he could easily walk up every day to the hut, and from there the uncle could take him all around the mountains.

This plan was accepted.
<hr>
The sun was in its highest point and the wind had almost stopped.

Only a soft wind blew on the Alp.

The uncle now got up and went into the hut.

He returned soon with milk, cheese( 奶酪 ), and meat that had been dried in the pure( 纯净的 ) air.

The doctor enjoyed his dinner better than any he had ever tasted.

“Yes, we must send Clara up here. She could get so strong!” he said.

“If she would have an appetite( 胃口 ) like mine today, she couldn’t help getting nice and fat.”

At this moment, a man could be seen walking up with a large sack( 麻袋 ) on his shoulders.

Arriving on top, he threw down his load( 负重 ), breathing( 呼吸 ) in the pure fresh air.

Opening the cover, the doctor said:

“This has come for you from Frankfurt( 法兰克福，地名 ), Heidi. Come and look what is in it.”

Heidi shyly watched the pile( 堆 ).

Only when the gentleman opened the box with the cakes for the grandmother she said joyfully( 高兴地 ),

“Oh, now grandmother can eat this lovely cake.”

She was taking the box and the beautiful scarf on her arm.

She was going to race down to deliver( 分发 ) the gifts, but the men persuaded( 说服 ) her to stay and unpack( 打开 ) the rest of the gifts.

She was very happy when she found all the other things.

When it was near sunset( 日落 ), the doctor rose to start on his way down.

The grandfather carried the box, the scarf and the sausage( 香肠 ).

Together they wandered( 走 ) down the mountain side.

When they reached Peter’s hut, Heidi was told to go inside and wait for her grandfather there.

At parting she asked,

“Would you like to come with me up to the pasture( 牧场 ) tomorrow, doctor?”

“With pleasure. Goodbye, Heidi,” was the reply.

The grandfather had placed all the presents in front of the door, and it took Heidi long to carry in the huge box and the sausage.

She put the scarf on the grandmother’s knee.

Brigida had silently watched what happened,

and could not open her eyes wide enough when she saw the enormous( 巨大的 ) sausage.

She had never seen such thing in her life, and now it was hers and she could cut it herself.

At this moment Peter came in.

“The uncle is coming up behind me, and Heidi must—” that was as far as he got, for his eyes had fastened on( 集中注意力于... ) the sausage.

It was too late, and the grandfather called through the open door:

“Heidi, come, you must get your sleep.”

Saying good night to all of them, he took Heidi by the hand,

and under the shining stars they wandered home to their peaceful cottage.

Early the next morning the doctor climbed up the mountain in company with Peter and his goats.

The friendly gentleman made several attempts to start a conversation with the boy, but the boy hardly answered.

When they arrived on top, they found Heidi already waiting, fresh as the early dawn( 黎明 ).

“Are you coming?” asked Peter as usual.

“Of course I shall, if the doctor comes with us,” replied the child.

The grandfather, coming out of the hut, greeted( 向...问候 ) the newcomer with great respect.

Then he went up to Peter, and hung the sack( 麻袋 ) over Peter’s shoulder, which seemed heavier than usual that day.

When they had started on their way, the goats were all around Heidi, but she kept urging( 催促 ) them forward.

When at last she was walking peacefully by the doctor’s side, she began to tell him many things about the goats.

She told him about their strange acts, and about the flowers, rocks and birds they saw.

When they arrived at their destination( 目的地 ), time seemed to have flown.

All the time Peter was sending many angry glances( 瞥 ) at the doctor, who never even noticed it.

Now that Heidi had come again to the pasture( 牧场 ) with him, she did nothing but talk to the old gentleman.

It made him very cross( 生气的 ) that he was not even able to get near her.

When the sun was in its highest point, Peter knew that it was noon.

He called over to the other two with all his might:

“Time to eat.”

When Heidi was getting up to fetch( 拿 ) their lunch, the doctor just asked for a glass of milk, which was all he wanted.

The child also decided to only drink the milk, running over to Peter and informing him of their decision.

When the boy found that everything in the bag was his, he hurried with his task as never in his life before.

But he felt guilty( 感到内疚的 ) about his former anger at the kind gentleman.

Heidi and the doctor had wandered about the pasture till the gentleman had found it was time to go back to the village.

When they parted, Heidi waved( 招手 ) to him.

From time to time he turned about.

Seeing the child still standing there, he had to think of his own little daughter,

who used to wave to him like that when he went away from home.
<hr>
The weather was warm and sunny that month.

Every morning the doctor came up to the Alp, spending his day very often with the old man.

The uncle would show his guest all the herbs( 药草 ) that grew on hidden places.

He could tell many strange things of the beasts( 野兽 ) that lived in holes in rock or earth, or in the high tops of trees.

But he spent most of his days with Heidi.

Then the two would sit together on the child’s favorite spot( 地方 ), and Peter sat behind them by himself.

Heidi would sing him songs, and entertain( 使快乐 ) him with all the things she knew.

At last the beautiful month of September was over.

One morning the doctor came up with a sadder face than usual.

The time had come for him to go back to Frankfurt, and the uncle’s sadness at that news was great.

Heidi herself could hardly realize that her loving friend, whom she had been seeing every day, was really leaving.

The doctor himself did not want to go, for the Alp had become a home to him.

But it was necessary for him to go.

Shaking hands with the grandfather, he said good bye.

Heidi went along with him a little way.

Hand in hand they wandered down( 往下走 ), till the doctor stood still.

Then touching Heidi’s curly( 卷卷的 ) hair, he said,

“Now I must go, Heidi! I wish I could take you along with me to Frankfurt.”

Shaking hands, they parted.

Heidi stayed on the same spot, waving( 摇 ) her hand and looking after her friend till he seemed no bigger than a little dot( 点 ).

Then he looked back a last time at Heidi and the sunny Alp, saying to himself,

“It is beautiful up there.

Body and soul( 灵魂 ) get strengthened in that place and life seems worth living again.”

The snow lay deep around the Alm-hut.

It came all the way up to the windows, and the door had entirely disappeared. Around Peter’s hut it was the same.

When the boy went out to dig a way through the snow, he had to creep( 爬 ) through the window;

then he would sink( 沉 ) deep into the soft snow and kick with arms and legs to get free.

The uncle had moved down to the village with Heidi and his goats.

Near the church lay an old ruin( 废墟 ) that once had been a spacious building.

Years ago, when the uncle had come to the village with Tobias, he had lived there.

On approaching the house from the back, there was an open room, where nearly all the walls lay in ruins.

On one side, the remains of a church room could be seen, now covered with plants.

A large hall came next, with a beautiful stone floor and grass growing in the cracks( 缝隙 ) in the floor.

The uncle had made a wooden partition( 隔板 ) here for the goats, and covered the floor with straw( 稻草 ).

Several passages led finally to a room with a heavy iron door.

This room was still in good condition.

In one corner was a huge stove( 炉子 ), which nearly reached up to the ceiling( 天花板 ).

Heidi discovered a bed placed between the wall and the stove.

“Oh grandfather, I have found my bedroom,” shouted the little girl.

“Oh, how fine it is!”

Heidi was delighted( 高兴的 ) with her new home.

When Peter arrived the next day, she did not rest till he had seen every corner of the curious( 稀奇古怪的 ) place.

Heidi slept very well in her corner, but it took her many days to get used to it.

When she woke up in the morning and could not hear the fir( 冷杉 ) trees roar( 咆哮 ), she would wonder where she was.

But as soon as she heard her grandfather’s voice outside, she remembered everything and would jump merrily( 欢乐地 ) out of bed.

After four days had gone by, Heidi said to her grandfather,

“I must go to grandmother now, for she has been alone for so many days.”

But the grandfather shook his head and said,

“You can’t go yet, child.

The snow is very deep up there and is still falling.

Peter can hardly get through.

A little girl like you would be snowed up and lost in no time.

Wait a while till it freezes( 结冰 ) and then you can walk on top of it!”

Heidi was very sorry, but she was so busy now that the days flew by.

Every morning and afternoon she went to school, eagerly( 急切地 ) learning whatever she was taught.

She hardly ever saw Peter there, for he did not come very often.

But when Heidi came home towards evening, Peter generally paid her a visit.

After a few days the sun came out for a short time at noon, and the next morning the whole Alp shone like crystal( 水晶 ).

Peter came down to visit Heidi. Afterwards( 之后 ) Heidi climbed up with him, because she wanted to see grandmother.

When they went into the room, Peter’s mother was alone at the table mending( 修补 ).

The grandmother was nowhere to be seen.

Brigida told Heidi that the grandmother needed to stay in bed on those cold days, as she did not feel very strong.

That was something new for Heidi.

Quickly running to the old woman’s room, she found her lying in a narrow( 狭小的 ) bed, covered in her gray scarf and thin blanket( 毯子 ).

“Thank Heaven( 上帝 )!”

the grandmother shouted out when she heard Heidi’s step.

All autumn and winter long she was secretly afraid that Heidi would be taken away.

Peter had told her so much about the strange gentleman that had appeared,

and she was afraid Heidi may be leaving again soon.
<hr>
Heidi had approached the bed, asking anxiously( 焦急地 ),

“Are you very sick, grandmother?”

“No, no, child,” the old woman told her,

“but the frost( 霜 ) has gone into my body a little.”

“But, grandmother, your bed is lower at your head’s side, where it ought to be high.

No bed ought to be like that.”

“I know, child, I can feel it well.” So saying,

the old woman tried to change her position on the pillow( 枕头 ) that lay under her like a thin board.

“My pillow never was very thick, and sleeping on it all these years has made it flat.”

“Oh dear, if I had only asked Clara to give me the bed I had in Frankfurt!” Heidi said sadly.

“It had three big pillows on it;

I could hardly sleep because I kept sliding( 滑 ) down from them all the time.

Could you sleep with them, grandmother?”

“Of course, because that would keep me warm.

I could breathe( 呼吸 ) so much easier, too,” said the grandmother, trying to find a higher place to lie on.

“But I must not talk about it anymore, for I have to be thankful for many things.

I get the lovely roll( 面包卷 ) every day and have this beautiful warm scarf.

I also have you, my child!

Heidi, wouldn’t you like to read me something today?”

Heidi immediately fetched( 拿 ) the book and read one song after another.

While she was reading, the grandmother was lying with folded( 交叠的 ) hands.

Her face, which had been so sad a short time ago, was lit up with a happy smile.

When she had finished reading, the child said good night.

Pulling Peter with her, she ran outside.

The bright moon was shining down on the white snow, light as day.

Peter had prepared a sled( 雪橇 ) to take Heidi home.

The two children were already flying down the Alp, like birds flying through the air.

After Heidi had gone to bed that night, she lay awake a little while, thinking over everything the grandmother had said.

If only poor grandmother could hear those comforting words every day!

Suddenly Heidi had an idea.

It excited her so much that she could hardly wait till morning came to start with her plan.

But in her excitement she had forgotten her evening prayer( 祷告词 ).

So, sitting up in bed, she prayed( 祈祷 ) to God.

Then, falling back into the fragrant( 芳香的 ) hay( 干草 ), she soon slept peacefully and soundly( 酣甜地 ) till the bright morning came.

The next evening, Peter paid a visit to Heidi, as usual.

The minute he opened the door she ran up to him, saying,

“Peter, I have to tell you something.”

“Say it,” he replied.

“You must learn to read now,” said the child.

“I have done it already.”

“Yes, yes, Peter, but I don’t mean it that way,” Heidi went on.

“You must learn so that you really know how to read later.”

“I can’t,” Peter remarked( 说 ).

“I’ll teach you, for I know how;

when you have learnt it, you must read one or two songs to grandmother every day.”

“I shan’t!” answered the boy.

This refusal made Heidi very angry.

With flaming( 发火的 ) eyes, she planted( 站定 ) herself before the boy and said,

“I’ll tell you what will happen, if you don’t want to learn.

Your mother has often said that she’ll send you to Frankfurt.

Clara showed me the terrible, large boys’ school there, where you’ll have to go.

There are whole rows of teachers there, and when they are out walking they have high black hats on their heads.

I saw them myself, when I was in Frankfurt!”

Cold shivers( 冷颤 ) ran down Peter’s back.

“Yes, you’ll have to go there,

and when they find out that you can’t read or even spell, they’ll laugh at you!”

“I’ll do it,” said Peter, half angry and half frightened( 害怕的 ).

“Oh, I am glad. Let us start right away!” said Heidi joyfully( 高兴地 ), pulling Peter over to the table.

Among the things that Clara had sent, Heidi had found a little book with the A, B, C and some rhymes( 押韵 ).

She had chosen this for the lessons.

Peter had great difficulty spelling the first rhyme.

Heidi said,

“I’ll read it to you, and then you’ll be able to do it better.”

Then Heidi began to read the letter rhymes to Peter, who learned them unwillingly but quickly.

Thus the days passed by.

In all this time Peter had really made some progress, though the rhymes still gave him difficulty.

Before it was time to go, Peter knew the last letter, and had even begun to read short words.

From this day on he progressed more quickly.

It was three weeks since Heidi had paid her last visit to the grandmother, for much snow had fallen since.

One evening, Peter, coming home, said happily:

“I can do it!”

“What is it you can do, Peter?” asked his mother, eagerly.

“Read.”

“What, is it possible? Did you hear it, grandmother?” said Brigida.

The grandmother also was curious( 好奇的 ) how this had happened.

“I must read a song now; Heidi told me to,” Peter continued.

To the women’s great surprise, Peter began.

After every sentence his mother would shout,

“Who would have ever thought it!” while the grandmother remained silent.
<hr>
Every evening now on his return home, Peter would read one song to his grandmother, but never more.

Brigida praised him, but the old woman once replied,

“I am glad he has learnt something.

But still I am longing for the spring to come.

Then Heidi can visit me, for when she reads, the songs sound so different.

I cannot always follow Peter, and the songs don’t excite me the way they do when Heidi says them!”

And no wonder!

For Peter would often leave out long and difficult words—what did three or four words matter!

So it happened sometimes that there were hardly any words left in the songs that Peter read.

May had come.

Warm sunshine was bathing( 照耀 ) the whole Alp in glorious( 灿烂的 ) light.

Having melted( 融化 ) the last snow, it had brought the first spring flowers to the surface.

A merry( 令人愉快的 ) spring wind was blowing, drying up the wet places in the shadow( 阴影 ).

High above in the blue sky the eagle( 鹰 ) flew peacefully.

Heidi and her grandfather were back on the Alp.

The child was so happy to be home again that she jumped about among the objects she loved.

Peter arrived, whistling( 吹口哨 ) and calling.

As usual, Heidi was soon surrounded( 被包围 ) by the goats( 山羊 ), who also seemed happy to be back on the Alp.

Peter, angrily pushing the goats aside, marched up to Heidi, putting a letter into her hand.

Heidi immediately recognized( 认出 ) Clara’s handwriting.

Running to her grandfather, she shouted out,

“A letter has come from Clara! Wouldn’t you like me to read it to you, grandfather?”

Peter had followed Heidi, and she immediately read aloud to her two listeners, as follows:—

Dear Heidi,

We are all packed up( 整理好行装 ) and shall travel in two or three days.

Papa is leaving, too, but not with us, for he has to go to Paris( 巴黎，地名 ) first.

The dear doctor came nearly every day this winter.

He told us all about you and the grandfather and the mountains and the flowers he saw.

He is much better since his visit, and seems younger and happier.

Oh, how I look forward to it all!

The doctor’s advice is that I shall go to Ragatz first for about six weeks.

Then I can go to live in the village, and from there I shall come to see you every fine day.

Grandmama, who is coming with me, is looking forward to the trip too.

Goodbye, dear Heidi, with much love from grandmama,

I am your true friend,

Clara.

When Peter heard this, he swung( 摆动 ) his rod( 杆 ) from right to left.

Angrily driving the goats before him, he ran down the hill.

The month of June was nearing its end and flowers were growing everywhere, filling the air with perfume( 香味 ).

One morning Heidi came running out of the hut, where she had already completed her duties.

Suddenly she screamed( 喊叫 ) so loud that the grandfather hurriedly came out to see what had happened.

“Grandfather! Come here! Look, look!”

A strange group of people were climbing up the Alp.

First marched two men, carrying a chair with a young girl in it.

Then came a stately( 神态庄重的 ) lady on horseback( 马背 ), looking eagerly right and left.

Then an empty wheelchair, carried by a young fellow, who was followed by a porter( 门房 ).

“They are coming! They are coming!” cried Heidi in her joy( 欢乐 ), and soon the party had arrived at the top.

Great was the happiness of the children at seeing each other again.

When grandmama had come down from her horse, she said hello to Heidi first, and then turned to the uncle, who had approached the group.

The two met like old friends.

They had heard so much about each other.

After the first words were exchanged( 互相交谈 ), the grandmother said,

“My dear uncle, what a wonderful house you have.

Oh, how well my Heidi is looking, just like a little rose!”

she continued, drawing the child close to her side and patting( 轻拍 ) her cheeks( 脸颊 ).

“What glory everywhere! Clara, what do you say to it all?”

Clara, looking about her excitedly, cried:

“Oh, how wonderful, how glorious( 华丽的 )!

I have never dreamt it could be as beautiful as that.

Oh grandmama, I wish I could stay here!”

The uncle had busied himself in the meantime( 同时 ) with getting Clara’s wheelchair for her.

Then, going up to the girl, he gently lifted her into her seat.

Putting some covers over her knees, he tucked( 把...卷入 ) her feet in warmly.

“My dear uncle,” said the grandmama, surprised,

“please tell me where you learned that!

I shall send all the nurses I know here immediately.”

The uncle smiled faintly( 微微地 ), while he replied,

“It comes more from care than study.”

Clara had looked at the cloudless sky above and the rocky mountain tops for a long time.

Then she said longingly to Heidi,

“I wish I could walk round the hut to the fir( 冷杉 ) trees.

If I only could see all the things you told me so much about!”
<hr>
Heidi pushed with all her might, and look!

The wheelchair rolled( 滚 ) easily over the dry grass.

When they passed the empty goat shed( 棚 ), Clara said pitifully,

“Oh grandmama, if I could only wait up here for Schwänli and Bärli!

I am afraid I shan’t see Peter and his goats, if we have to go away so soon again.”

“Dear child, enjoy this moment,” said the grandmama, who had followed.

“Oh, what wonderful flowers!” said Clara again.

“There are whole bushes of( 一丛丛 ) excellent, red blossoms( 花 ).

Oh, if I could only pick some of those beautiful flowers!”

Heidi, immediately gathering( 采集 ) many of them, put them on Clara’s lap( 大腿 ).

“Clara, this is really nothing in comparison with the many flowers in the pasture( 牧场 ).

You must come up once and see them.”

“Oh, grandmama, do you think I can ever go up there?” Clara asked with a wild longing( 渴望 ) in her eyes.

“If I could only walk with you, Heidi, and climb round everywhere!”

“I’ll push you!” Heidi said for comfort.

To show how easy it was, she pushed the chair.

It moved so fast that it almost fell down the mountain, but the grandfather was there to stop it at the last moment.

It was time for lunch now.

The table was set up outside, and soon everybody sat down.

The grandmama was overcome( 被深深折服 ) by the view and the delicious wind that fanned her cheek( 脸颊 ).

She remarked( 说 ):

“What a wonderful place this is!

I have never seen anything like it! But what do I see?” she continued.

“I think you are eating your second piece of cheese( 奶酪 ), Clara?”

“Oh grandmama, it tastes better than all the things we get in Ragatz,”

replied the child, eagerly eating the tasty dish.

“That’s right, eat as much as you can!” said the old man satisfied.

“It’s the mountain air that makes up for the faults( 瑕疵 ) of the cooking.”

During the meal the uncle and the grandmama had soon got into a lively conversation.

They seemed to agree on many things, and understood each other like old friends.

A little later the grandmama looked over to the west.

“We must soon start, Clara, for the sun is already low; our guides will be here shortly.”

Clara’s face had become sad.

She asked whether she could still see the hut, and the grandmama agreed.

The wheelchair was too big for the door, so the uncle quietly lifted Clara in his strong arms and carried her in.

When the uncle showed her Heidi’s bedroom, she said,

“What a lovely place to sleep! Oh, Heidi, you can look right up to the sky from your bed.

You can hear the fir( 冷杉 ) trees roar( 咆哮 ) here, can’t you?

Oh, I never saw a more delightful( 使人愉快的 ) bedroom!”

The uncle, looking at the old lady, said now,

“I have an idea. I believe it would give Clara new strength to stay up here with us a little while.

You have brought so many covers that we can easily make a soft bed for Clara here.

My dear lady, you can easily leave the care to me.

I’ll undertake( 承担 ) it gladly.”

The children screamed( 大叫 ) for joy( 欢乐 ), and grandmama’s face was beaming( 眉开眼笑的 ).

“What a fine man you are!” she burst out( 说出口 ).

“I was just thinking myself that a stay here would strengthen the child, but then I thought of the care and trouble for you.

And now you have offered to do it, as if it was nothing at all.

How can I thank you enough, uncle?”

After shaking hands many times, the two prepared Clara’s bed.

Thanks to the old lady’s preparations, the bed was soon so soft that the hay( 干草 ) could not be felt at all.

The uncle had carried his new patient back to her wheelchair, and there they found her sitting, with Heidi beside her.

They were eagerly talking of their plans for the coming weeks.

When they were told that Clara might stay for a month or so, their faces beamed more than ever.

When the grandmama got ready to leave, she said that she would go back to Ragatz, but she promised to come back from time to time.

Peter came racing down to the hut with all his goats.

Seeing Heidi, they ran up to her quickly, and so Clara met Schwänli and Bärli and all the others.

Peter, however, kept away, only sending angry looks at the two girls.

When they said good night, he only ran away, beating the air with his stick.

The end of the joyous day had come.

The two children were both lying in their beds.

As soon as Heidi lay down, she fell asleep.

But Clara could not sleep quite yet, it was too wonderful to see the stars from her bed.

In truth, she had never seen them before.

In Frankfurt all the blinds( 窗帘 ) were always down long before the stars came out, and at night she had never been outside the house.

She could hardly keep her eyes shut.

She had to open them again and again to watch the stars, till her eyes closed at last and she saw two big twinkling( 闪闪发光的 ) stars in her dream.
<hr>
The sun was just rising.

Clara, having just a moment ago opened her eyes, looked about her in amazement( 惊讶 ).

Bright sunshine danced on her bed.

She had never slept better in all her life.

Heidi was soon awake, too, and lost no time in coming down to join Clara, who was already sitting in the sun.

A cool morning wind touched their cheeks( 脸颊 ), and the smell of the fir( 冷杉 ) trees filled their lungs( 肺 ) with every breath( 呼吸 ).

Clara had never breathed such pure( 纯净的 ), cool morning air and never felt such warm, delicious sunshine on her feet and hands.

It was better than she had ever dreamed.

The grandfather was just coming out of the shed( 棚 ) with two full bowls of warm, snow-white milk.

Handing one to each of the children, he said to Clara,

“This will do you good, little girl. It comes from Schwänli and will give you strength.”

At first Clara had hesitated( 犹豫 ) a little,

but when she saw that Heidi’s bowl was nearly empty already, she drank without stopping.

Oh, how good it was! It tasted like sugar.

“We’ll drink two tomorrow,” said the grandfather.

After their breakfast, Peter arrived.

Taking the uncle’s two goats, he started off quickly, angrily looking back now and then( 时不时地 ).

As Heidi had followed a little way, Peter called to her:

“You must come along, Heidi.”

“No, but I can’t,” Heidi called back.

“I won’t be able to come as long as Clara is with me.

Grandfather has promised, though, to let us come up with you one day.”

With those words Heidi returned to Clara, while the goatherd( 牧羊人 ) was hurrying on, angrily shaking his fists( 拳头 ).

The children had promised to write a letter to grandmama every day, so they immediately started on their task.

Heidi brought out her own little chair, her school books and her papers.

With the books and the papers on Clara’s lap( 大腿 ), they began to write.

The morning had passed, and lunch was ready.

They again ate outside, because Clara had to be in the open air all day.

The afternoon was spent in the cool shadow( 树荫处 ) of the fir trees.

It was not long before Peter arrived with his goats,

but without even answering the girls’ friendly greeting, he disappeared quickly with an angry look on his face.

While Schwänli was being milked in the shed, Clara said,

“Oh, Heidi, I feel as if I could not wait for my milk.

Isn’t it funny? All my life I have only eaten because I had to.

And now I am so hungry!”

When at last the full bowls were brought by the old man,

Clara eagerly drank the contents( 碗里盛的东西 ) in one time and even finished before Heidi.

“Please, may I have a little more?” she asked, holding out the bowl.

Nodding, much pleased, the grandfather soon refilled it.

This time he also brought a slice of( 一片 ) bread with him and butter( 黄油 ) for the children.

This evening Clara fell asleep the moment she lay down.

Two or three days passed in this pleasant way.

The next brought a surprise.

Two strong porters( 门房 ) came up the Alp, each carrying on his back a fresh, white bed.

They also brought a letter from grandmama.

She thanked the children for their faithful( 坚持的 ) writing, and told them that the beds were meant for them.

When they went to sleep that night, they found their new beds in exactly the same position as their former ones had been.

The grandfather took excellent care of his little patient.

Every day he climbed around to find the best food for Schwänli, so that her milk would be extra( 额外的 ) healthy.

It was the third week of Clara’s stay.

Every morning after the grandfather had carried her down, he said to her,

“Would my Clara try to stand a little?” Clara always sighed( 叹息 ),

“Oh, it hurts me so!”

but he made her stand a little longer every day, though she would hold on to him.

Heidi had told Clara over and over again of all the flowers on the pasture( 牧场 ),

of the masses of golden roses and the blue flowers that covered the ground.

She had just been telling it again, when a longing seized( 抓住 ) her.

She jumped up and ran over to her grandfather, who was busy in his workshop( 工作间 ).

“Oh, grandfather,” she cried from far away,

“won’t you come with us to the pasture tomorrow? Oh, it’s so beautiful up there now.”

“All right, I will,” he replied;

“but tell Clara that she must do something to please me;

she must try to stand longer this evening for me.”

Heidi merrily( 欢乐地 ) came running with her message.

Of course, Clara promised, for it was her greatest wish to go up with Heidi to the pasture!

When Peter returned this evening, he heard of the plan for the next day.

But for answer Peter only made a low sound, nearly hitting poor Thistlefinch in his anger.

The next day started cloudless and fair.

The grandfather was still with the children, when Peter came climbing up;

his goats kept at a good distance from him, to get away from the rod( 杆 ), which was striking right and left.

The truth was that the boy was terribly angry by the changes that had come.

When he passed the hut in the morning, Heidi was always busy with the strange child, and in the evening it was the same.

All summer long Heidi had not been up with him for a single time; it was too much!

And today she was coming at last, but again in company with this hateful stranger.
<hr>
It was then that Peter noticed the wheelchair standing near the hut.

After carefully glancing( 扫视 ) about him, he rushed at the hated object and pushed it down the mountain side.

The chair fairly flew away and had soon disappeared.

Peter felt frightened( 害怕的 ) now, and he raced up the Alp,

not daring( 不敢 ) to pause( 停 ) till he had reached a place where he could hide from the uncle.

Looking down, he watched his fallen enemy going downwards( 往下走 ), downwards.

Pieces were falling from it right and left, and were blown about.

Now the stranger would have to go away and Heidi would be his again!

But Peter had forgotten that a bad act always brings a punishment.

Heidi just now came out of the hut.

The grandfather, with Clara, followed.

Heidi at first stood still.

And then, running right and left, she returned to the old man.

“The wheelchair is gone!” Heidi cried.

At this moment, a strong wind was blowing, which violently( 猛烈地 ) closed the workshop( 工场 ) door.

“Grandfather, the wind has done it,” said Heidi eagerly.

“Oh dear! If it has fallen all the way down to the village, it will be too late to go today.

It will take us a long time to fetch( 拿 ) it.”

“If it has fallen down there, we shall never get it anymore.

It will be broken to pieces,” said the old man,

looking down and measuring( 测量 ) the distance from the corner of the hut.

“I don’t see how it happened,” he remarked( 说 ).

“What a shame! Now I’ll never be able to go up to the pasture( 牧场 ),” said Clara sadly.

“I am afraid I’ll have to go home now. What a pity, what a pity!”

“You can find a way for her to stay, grandfather, can’t you?”

“We’ll go up to the pasture today, as we have planned.

Then we shall see what further happens.”

The children were delighted( 高兴的 ), and the grandfather lost no time in getting ready.

First he fetched a pile of( 一堆 ) covers, and seating Clara on a sunny spot( 地方 ) on the dry ground, he got their breakfast.

“I wonder why Peter is so late today,” he said, leading his goats outside.

Then, lifting Clara up on one strong arm, he carried the covers on the other.

“Now, march( 前进 )!” he cried.

“The goats come with us.”

They were all astonished( 震惊的 ) when, arriving on top,

they saw Peter already lying on the ground, with his peaceful goats about him.

“What did you mean by going by us like that? I’ll teach you!” called the uncle to him.

Peter was frightened, for he knew the voice.

“Nobody was awake yet,” the boy replied.

“Have you seen the chair?” asked the uncle again.

“Which?” Peter asked.

The uncle said no more.

Unfolding( 交叠 ) the covers, he put Clara down on the dry grass.

Then, when he was certain of Clara’s comfort, he got ready to go home.

The three were to stay there till his return in the evening.

The sky was a deep blue, and the snow on the peaks( 山顶 ) was shining.

The eagle( 鹰 ) was flying above the rocky mountains.

The children felt wonderfully happy.

They had been sitting quietly for a few hours, getting lost in the beauty about them.

Heidi suddenly began to long for the spot where so many flowers grew.

“Oh, Clara,” she said hesitatingly( 犹豫地 ),

“would you be angry if I went away from you a minute and left you alone?

I want to see the flowers; But wait!—”

Jumping away, she brought Clara some plants and put them on her lap( 大腿 ).

Soon after, she returned with little Snowhopper.

“So, now you don’t need to be alone,” said Heidi.

When Clara had told her that it would give her pleasure to be left alone with the goats, Heidi started on her walk.

Clara slowly handed one leaf after another to the little creature( 生物 ), who trusted her more and more.

Coming close to the child, it ate the plants out of her hand. Clara felt such a feeling of satisfaction as she had never experienced before.

She loved to sit there on the mountain side with the little goat by her.

A great desire rose in her heart that hour.

She longed to be her own master( 主人 ) and be able to help others instead of being helped by them.

Many other thoughts and ideas rushed through her mind.

The world seemed so joyous( 欢乐的 ) and wonderful all of a sudden.

Heidi in the meantime( 同时 ) had reached the spot.

As she had expected, the whole ground was covered with yellow roses.

The flowers were nodding gently in the soft wind.

But all the perfume( 香气 ) that filled the air came from the tiny little brown flowers that hid their heads between the golden flowers.

Heidi stood without moving, breathing( 呼吸 ) in the perfumed( 芳香的 ) air.

Suddenly she turned and ran back to Clara, shouting to her from far:

“Oh, you must come, Clara, it is so lovely there.

In the evening it won’t be so fine anymore.

Don’t you think I could carry you?”

“But Heidi,” Clara said,

“of course you can’t; you are much smaller than I am. Oh, I wish I could walk!”

Heidi thought for a little while.

Peter was still lying on the ground.

He had been staring at( 盯着 ) the two children for hours, unable to believe what he saw before him.

He had destroyed( 摧毁 ) the chair to get rid of( 摆脱 ) the stranger, and there she was again, sitting right beside his playmate( 玩伴 ).
<hr>
Heidi now called to him to come down, but as reply he only said,

“Shan’t come.”

“But you must; come quickly, for I want you to help me. Quickly!” urged( 催促 ) the child.

“Don’t want to,” was the reply.

Heidi hurried up the mountain now and shouted angrily to the boy:

“Peter, if you don’t come this minute, I shall do something that you won’t like.”

Those words scared( 使惊吓 ) Peter, for he knew he had done something wrong.

He had thought himself safe till this moment, when Heidi seemed to talk as if she knew it all.

What if the grandfather should hear about it!

Shaking with fear, Peter obeyed( 听从 ).

“I shall only come if you promise not to do what you said,” insisted( 坚持 ) the boy.

“No, no, I won’t. Don’t be afraid,” said Heidi.

“Just come along; it isn’t so hard.”

Peter, on approaching Clara, was told to help raise the child from the ground on one side, while Heidi helped on the other.

This went easily enough, but difficulties soon followed.

Clara was not able to stand alone, and how could they get any further?

“You must put one arm around my neck, and put the other around Peter’s and lean( 靠 ) firmly upon it,

then we shall be able to carry you!” said Heidi.

The boy, who had never offered his arm to anybody in his life,

had to be shown how to do so first, before further efforts could be made.

But it was too hard. Clara tried to set her feet forward, but she lost hope.

“Press your feet on the ground more and I am sure it will hurt you less,” suggested Heidi.

“Do you think so?” said Clara, nervously.

But, obeying, she put her foot on the ground more firmly and soon another, giving a little cry as she went.

“Oh, it really has hurt me less,” she said joyfully( 高兴地 ).

“Try it again,” Heidi urged her.

Clara did, and took another step, and then another, and another still.

Suddenly she cried aloud:

“Oh, Heidi, I can do it. Oh, I really can. Just look! I can take steps, one after another.”

Heidi exclaimed( 大声喊叫 ):

“Oh, Clara, can you really? Can you take steps now? Oh, if only grandfather would come!

Now you can walk, Clara, now you can walk,” she kept on saying joyfully.

Clara held on tight( 紧紧地 ) to the children, but with every new step she became more firm.

“Now you can come up here every day,” cried Heidi.

“Now we can walk wherever we want to, and you don’t have to be pushed in a chair anymore.

Now you’ll be able to walk all your life. Oh, what joy!”

Clara’s greatest wish, to be well like other people, had been fulfilled( 实现 ) at last.

The two children could hardly believe this happiness that had come to them.

It filled their hearts and made them silent.

Thus the hours flew, and the day was long past noon.

Soon after, the grandfather was seen climbing up the Alp.

Heidi ran to meet him, telling him of the great event.

The old man’s face shone at this news. Going over to Clara, he said,

“So you have risked it? Now we have won.”

Then picking her up, he put one arm around her waist( 腰 ), and he held out the other one as support.

With his help she marched more firmly than ever.

Heidi jumped happily by their side.

In all this excitement the grandfather did not lose his judgement( 判断 ), and before long he lifted Clara on his arm to carry her home.

He knew that tiring her too much would be dangerous, and rest was needed for the girl.

Peter, arriving in the village late that day, saw many people talking together.

They were all standing about an interesting object, and everybody pushed and fought for a chance to get nearest.

It was no other than the chair.

“I saw it when they carried it up,” Peter heard the baker( 面包师 ) say.

“I am sure it was worth a lot of money. I should just like to know how it has happened.

“When the gentleman from Frankfurt hears what has happened,

he’ll surely find out all about it, and I should pity whoever did it.

I am glad I haven’t been up on the Alp for so long! Otherwise they might suspect( 怀疑 ) me.”

Many more opinions were shared, but Peter had heard enough.

He quietly slipped away( 溜走 ) and went home.

What if they should find out he had done it?

A policeman might arrive any time now and they might take him away to prison( 监狱 ).

Peter’s hair stood up on end at this alarming( 令人忧虑的 ) thought.

He was so troubled when he came home that he did not answer any questions and even refused his dish of potatoes.

Hurriedly, he got into bed.

Next morning a letter was written to grandmama, inviting her to come up to the Alp within a week.

The children had planned to surprise her with the news.

Clara hoped then to be able to walk alone, with Heidi as her guide.

The following days were happier still for Clara.

She progressed, and took longer walks every day.

She got hungrier every day, and the grandfather had to make larger slices( 片 ) of the bread and butter( 黄油 ) that, to his delight( 高兴 ), disappeared so rapidly.

He had to fill bowl after bowl of the warm milk for the hungry children.

In that way they reached the end of the week that was to bring the grandmama.
<hr>
A day before her visit, the grandmama had sent a letter to announce( 通知 ) her coming.

Peter brought it up with him next morning.

The grandfather was already before the hut with the children and his merry( 欢乐的 ) goats.

His face looked proud, as he looked at the red faces of the girls and the shining hair of his two goats.

Peter, approaching, neared the uncle slowly.

As soon as he had delivered( 投递 ) the letter, he sprang back shyly, looking about him as if he was afraid.

Then with a jump he started off.

All the way Peter was taken by fear.

He could not help thinking of the policeman who was coming from Frankfurt( 法兰克福，地名 ) to bring him to prison( 监狱 ).

It was a busy morning for Heidi, who put the hut in order for the expected visitor.

The grandfather also returned from a walk, on which he had gathered( 聚集 ) a lot of glorious( 美丽的 ) deep blue flowers.

The children, who were sitting near the house, shouted for joy( 欢乐 ) when they saw the flowers.

Heidi, getting up from time to time to look down the path( 小路 ),

suddenly discovered grandmama, sitting on a white horse and accompanied( 陪伴 ) by two men.

The party came nearer and nearer, and soon reached the top.

“What do I see? Clara, what is this? Why are you not sitting in your chair? How is this possible?”

cried the grandmama in alarm( 慌张 ), while she quickly got off her horse.

Before she had quite reached the children, she threw her arms up in great excitement:

“Clara, is that really you? You have a red, round cheek( 脸颊 ), my child! I hardly know you anymore!”

Grandmama was going to rush at her grandchild, when Heidi was getting up, and Clara, taking her arm, got up too.

They quietly took a little walk.

The grandmama was rooted to the spot( 呆住不动 ) from fear.

What was this? Straightly and firmly, Clara walked beside her friend.

When they came back, their red faces beamed( 眉开眼笑 ).

Rushing toward the children, the grandmama hugged( 拥抱 ) them over and over again.

Then the grandmama looked at the uncle, who sat on the bench( 长凳 ) smiling.

Taking Clara’s arm in hers, she walked over to him, continually expressing her delight( 高兴 ).

When she reached the old man, she took both his hands in hers and said,

“My dear, dear uncle! How much we have to thank you for! This is your work, your care and nursing—”

Then Clara called,

“Yes, and also Schwänli’s good, delicious milk.

Grandmama, you ought to see how much goat milk I can drink now; oh, it is so good!”

“Indeed, I can see that from your cheeks,” said the grandmama, smiling.

“I hardly recognize( 认出 ) you anymore. Now I must telegraph( 给...发电报 ) your father to come.

But I shan’t tell him anything about you, for it will be the greatest joy of all his life.

My dear uncle, how are we going to manage it?

Have you sent the two men who accompanied me away?”

“I have, but I can easily send the goatherd( 牧羊人 ).”

So they decided that Peter should take the message.

The uncle immediately whistled( 吹口哨 ) so loud that it could be heard everywhere.

Soon Peter arrived, white with fear, for he thought the grandfather had found out what he had done.

But he only received a paper that was to be carried to the post office of the village.

Relieved( 放松的 ) for the moment, Peter set out.

Meanwhile( 同时 ) Mr. Sesemann, having finished his business in Paris( 巴黎，地名 ), was also preparing a surprise.

Without writing to his mother, he traveled to Ragatz on a sunny summer morning.

He had arrived on this very day, some hours after his mother’s departure( 离开 ).

And now, taking a carriage, he drove to Mayenfeld.

The long way up to the Alp from there seemed very tiring and far to the traveler.

When would he reach the grandfather’s hut?

There were many little roads branching( 分叉 ) off in several directions,

and sometimes Mr. Sesemann doubted if he had taken the right path.

Standing still and cooling his face, he saw a boy running down the hill at topmost speed.

Mr. Sesemann called to him, but with no success, for the boy kept at a shy distance.

“Now, my boy, can’t you tell me if I am on the right path to the hut

where Heidi lives and the people from Frankfurt are staying?”

A low sound of terror( 惊恐 ) was the only reply.

Peter shot off and rushed head over heels( 用尽全力地 ) down the mountain side.

“What a funny, shy mountaineer!” Mr. Sesemann remarked( 说 ) to himself.

After watching the boy going down a little while, he soon went on his way.

Despite the greatest effort, Peter could not stop himself, and kept rolling down( 滚下 ) the mountain.

But his fright( 害怕 ) was still more terrible than the pain.

This stranger was the policeman—that was a certain fact!

At last Peter was caught in a bush( 灌木丛 ), and was able to keep himself from falling any farther.

Peter got back to his feet.

He longed to go home to bed and hide, for he only felt safe there.

But he had to go up to the goats, and the uncle had clearly told him to come back as quickly as he could.

Groaning( 呻吟 ), he walked up to the Alp.

How could he run now, with his fear and his poor, painful body?
<hr>
Mr. Sesemann, climbing further, at last saw his goal( 目标 ) before him.

He eagerly( 心切地 ) hurried to see the daughter he loved so much.

They had seen him long ago from the hut, and a treat was prepared for him that he never expected.

As he made the last steps, he saw two forms coming towards him.

A tall girl, with light hair and red face, was holding on to Heidi, whose dark eyes shone with delight( 高兴 ).

Mr. Sesemann stopped short, staring( 盯 ) at this scene.

Suddenly big tears( 眼泪 ) rushed from his eyes, for this fair girl before him looked the same as Clara’s mother.

Mr. Sesemann at this moment did not know if he was awake or dreaming.

“Papa, don’t you know me anymore?” Clara called with beaming( 眉开眼笑的 ) eyes.

“Have I changed so much?”

Mr. Sesemann rushed up to her, folding( 交叠 ) her in his arms.

“Yes, you have changed. How is it possible? Is it really true? Is it really you, Clara?”

asked the overjoyed( 欣喜若狂的 ) father, hugging( 拥抱 ) her again and again.

His mother joined them now, for she wanted to see the happiness of her son.

“What do you say to this, my son? Isn’t our surprise finer than yours?” she greeted( 同...打招呼 ) him.

“But come over to the one who helped us now—I mean the uncle.”

“Yes, indeed, I also must greet our little Heidi and the Uncle,” said the gentleman, shaking Heidi’s hand.

“Well? Always fresh and happy on the mountain?

I guess I don’t need to ask, for no Alpine( 高山的 ) rose can look healthier.

Ah, child, what joy this is to me!”

With beaming eyes, the child looked at the kind gentleman who had always been so good to her.

While the two men, who had at last approached each other, were conversing( 交谈 ), grandmama walked over to the trees.

There, under the fir( 冷杉 ) trees, another surprise awaited( 等待 ) her.

A lot of beautiful blue flowers stood as if they had grown there.

“How excellent, how wonderful! What a sight!” she shouted, clapping( 拍 ) her hands.

“Heidi, come here! Have you brought me those? Oh, they are beautiful!”

The children had joined her. Heidi told her that it was another person’s deed( 行为 ).

At that moment a sound was heard, and they saw Peter, who was trying to go up behind the trees to avoid the hut.

Immediately the old lady called to him, for she thought that Peter himself had picked the flowers for her.

He must be creeping( 爬 ) away out of modesty( 谦逊 ), the kind lady thought.

To give him his reward( 报酬 ), she called:

“Come here, my boy! Don’t be afraid.”

With his hair standing up on end, Peter approached.

“Come straight to me, boy,” the old lady encouraged him.

“Now tell me, boy, if you have done that.”

In his anxiety( 焦急 ), Peter did not see the grandmama’s finger that pointed to the flowers.

He only saw the uncle standing near the hut, watching him closely,

and beside him was the policeman, the person he was most afraid of.

Trembling( 颤抖 ) in his whole body, Peter answered,

“Yes!”

“Well, but what are you so frightened( 感到害怕的 ) about?”

“Because—because it is broken and can never be mended( 被修补 ) again,” Peter said, with his knees shaking under him.

The grandmama now walked over to the hut:

“My dear uncle,” she asked kindly,

“is this poor boy out of his mind?”

“Not at all,” was the reply;

“only the boy was the wind which blew away the wheelchair.

He is expecting the punishment he well deserves( 应得 ).”

Grandmama was very much surprised, for she thought that Peter looked like he would not do something like that.

Why should he have destroyed( 破坏 ) the chair?

The uncle told her that he had noticed many signs of anger in the boy since Clara had arrived on the Alp.

He told the grandmama that he had suspected( 怀疑 ) the boy from the beginning.

“My dear uncle,” the old lady said,

“we must not punish him further. We must be just.

It was very hard on him when Clara took Heidi from him, who is and was his greatest treasure.

When he had to sit alone day after day, he got angrier and angrier, which drove him to this bad act.

It was rather foolish( 愚蠢的 ), but we all get so when we get angry.”

The lady walked over to the boy again, who was still trembling with fear.

Sitting down on the bench( 长凳 ), she began:

“Come, Peter, I’ll tell you something.

Stop trembling and listen. You pushed the chair down, to destroy it.

You knew very well that it was bad and deserved punishment.

But you have made a mistake by thinking that you would hurt Clara by destroying her chair.

It has happened that what you have done has been the greatest good for her.

She would probably never have tried to walk, if her chair had been there.

Now tell me if you have a wish, my boy, for I am going to give you something to remember your friends from Frankfurt.

What is it? What would you like to have?”

Peter, lifting his head, stared at the grandmama with round, astonished( 震惊的 ) eyes.

He would get rewarded instead of punished!
<hr>
Being again urged( 被催促 ) to say a wish, he saw at last that he was saved from the policeman.

He felt as if the most terrible fear had left him.

He knew now that it was better to confess( 承认 ) at once, when something had gone wrong, so he said,

“I have also lost the paper.”

Thinking for a while, the grandmama understood and said:

“That is right. Always confess what is wrong, then it can be settled( 被解决 ).

And now, what would you like to have?”

So Peter could choose everything in the world he wished. His brain got dizzy( 晕眩的 ).

He saw before him all the wonderful things in the fair in Mayenfeld.

He had often stood there for hours, looking at the pretty red whistles( 口哨 ) and the little knives;

unfortunately( 不幸地 ) Peter had never possessed( 拥有 ) enough money to buy half of those objects.

He stood thinking, not able to decide, when a bright thought struck him.

“Ten cents,” said Peter with decision.

“That certainly is not too much,” the old lady said with a smile.

She took a bank note out of her pocket, on top of which she laid twenty cents.

“Now I’ll explain this to you. You will have ten cents every week of the year.

You’ll be able to spend them every Sunday through the year.”

“All my life?” Peter asked quite innocently( 天真地 ).

Laughingly she said,

“You shall have it, my boy.

I will put it in my will and then you will do the same, my son. Listen!

Peter the goatherd( 牧羊人 ) shall have a ten-cent piece weekly as long as he lives.”

Peter, looking at his gift, said seriously,

“God be thanked!” Jumping up, he ran away.

His heart was so light that he felt he could fly.

A little later the whole party sat round the table, holding a dinner to celebrate.

After dinner, Clara, who was lively as never before, said to her father:

“Oh, Papa, if you only knew all the things grandfather did for me.

It would take many days to tell you; I shall never forget them all my life.

Oh, if we could please him only half as much as what he did for me.”

“It is my greatest wish, too, dear child,” said her father;

“I have been trying to think of something all the time.

We have to show our gratitude( 感激 ) in some way.”

Accordingly, Mr. Sesemann walked over to the old man, and began:

“My dear friend, may I say one word to you?

I am sure you believe me when I tell you that I have not known any real joy( 欢乐 ) for years.

My wealth was nothing to me when I could not help my child and make her happy!

You have given her a new life. Please tell me how to thank you.

I know I shall never be able to repay( 报答 ) you, but I shall do everything in my power to try it.

Can I do anything for you? Please let me know.”

The uncle had listened quietly and had looked at the happy father.

“Mr. Sesemann, you can be sure that I am also repaid by the great joy I experience at seeing Clara get better,”

said the uncle firmly.

“I thank you for your kind offer, Mr. Sesemann.

As long as I live, I have enough for me and the child.

But I have one wish.

If this could be fulfilled( 实现 ), my life would be free of care.”

“Speak, my dear friend,” said Clara’s father.

“I am old,” continued the uncle,

“and shall not live many years. When I die I cannot leave Heidi anything.

If you promise me that Heidi will never have to go into the world and earn( 赚 ) her bread,

you would repay me for what I was able to do for you and Clara.”

“My dear friend, there is no question of that,” began Mr. Sesemann;

“the child belongs to( 属于 ) us! I promise at once that we shall look after her.

We all know that she is not suited( 适合 ) to live a life away from home.

Still, she has made some true friends, and one of them will be here very shortly.

The doctor is just now completing his last business in Frankfurt.

He plans to take your advice and live here.

He has never felt so happy as with you and Heidi.

The child will have two protectors near her,

and I hope with God’s will, that they may live a long, long time.”

The grandmama now put her arms around the child and said,

“Heidi, I want to know if you also have a wish?”

“Yes indeed, I have,” said Heidi, pleased.

“Tell me what it is, child!”

“I should like to have my bed from Frankfurt with the three high pillows( 枕头 ) and the thick, warm cover.

Then grandmother will be able to keep warm and won’t have to wear her scarf in bed.”

“Oh dear, I had nearly forgotten what I meant to do.

I am so glad you have reminded( 提醒 ) me, Heidi.

I shall ask immediately for the bed, and if Miss Rottenmeier sends it off at once, it can be here in two days.

I hope the poor blind grandmother will sleep better when it comes.”
<hr>
Heidi, in her happiness, could hardly wait to bring the old woman the good news.

Soon it was decided that everybody should visit the grandmother, who had been left alone so long.

Before starting, however, Mr. Sesemann told them his plans.

He wanted to travel through Switzerland( 瑞士，地名 ) with his mother and Clara.

He would spend the night in the village, so as to fetch( 带 ) Clara from the Alp next morning for the journey.

From there they would go first to Ragatz and then further.

Clara’s feelings( 感受 ) were divided, for she was sorry to leave the Alp, but the plan of the trip delighted( 使高兴 ) her.

When everything was settled( 被安排好 ), they all went down.

The uncle carried Clara, who could not have risked the lengthy walk.

All the way down Heidi told the old lady of her friends in the hut,

about the cold they had to bear in winter, and the little food they had.

Brigida was just hanging up Peter’s shirt to dry, when the whole company arrived.

Rushing into the house, she called to her mother:

“Now they are all going away. Uncle is going, too, carrying the lame( 跛的 ) child.”

“Oh, must it really be?” sighed( 叹息 ) the grandmother.

“Have you seen whether they took Heidi away?

Oh, if she could only give me her hand once more!

Oh, I long to hear her voice once more!”

The same moment the door was thrown open and Heidi held her tight( 紧紧地 ).

“Grandmother, just think.

My bed with the three pillows( 枕头 ) and the thick cover is coming from Frankfurt.

Grandmama has said that it will be here in two days.”

“Oh, what a good lady she must be!

I know I ought to be glad she is taking you with her, but I don’t think I shall live long when you are gone.”

“But nobody has said so,” the grandmama said kindly.

Pressing the old woman’s hand, she continued,

“It is out of the question. Heidi will stay with you and make you happy.”

“Oh, what wonderful things God is doing for me!” said the grandmother, deeply touched.

“My dear grandmother,” said Mrs. Sesemann,

“now we must say goodbye; next year we shall come to see you just as soon as we come up the Alp.

We shall never forget you!” With that, Mrs. Sesemann shook her hand.

It was some time before Mrs. Sesemann was allowed to leave,

because the grandmother thanked her over and over again.

Mr. Sesemann and his mother went on downward( 向下 ), while Clara was carried up to spend her last night in the hut.

Next morning, Clara cried hot tears( 眼泪 ) at parting from the place she loved, where such gladness had been hers.

Heidi comforted her with plans for the coming summer, which was to be even happier than this one.

Mr. Sesemann then arrived, and a few last parting words were said.

Clara, half crying, suddenly said,

“Please give my love to Peter and the goats, Heidi!

Please greet( 向...问候 ) Schwänli especially from me, for she has helped a great deal in making me well.”

It was time to go now, and Clara was able to ride proudly beside her father.

Standing on the edge of the mountain, Heidi waved( 挥动 ) her hand, with her eyes following Clara till she had disappeared.

The bed has arrived.

Grandmother now sleeps so well every night that before long she will be stronger than ever.

Grandmama has not forgotten the cold winter on the Alp and has sent a great many warm covers and scarfs( 围巾 ) to the goatherd’s hut.

Grandmother can wrap( 裹 ) herself now and will not have to sit shaking in a corner.

In the village a large building is in progress.

The doctor has arrived and is living at present in his old quarters.

He has taken the uncle’s advice and has bought the old ruins( 废墟 ) that sheltered( 庇护 ) Heidi and her grandfather before.

He is rebuilding the part with the fine apartment( 公寓 ) for himself.

The other side is being prepared for Heidi and her grandfather.

The doctor knows that his friend is an independent man and likes to have his own space.

Bärli and Schwänli, of course, are not forgotten;

they will spend the winter in a good new shed( 棚 ) that is being built for them.

The doctor and the Alm-Uncle become better friends every day.

They have agreed to share together the pleasure and responsibility( 责任 ) that Heidi brings them.

The uncle is so thankful that he cannot express it in words, when the doctor tells him that he will provide for the child.

Now her grandfather’s heart is free of care.

Even if he is called away, another father will take care of Heidi and love her instead.

At the moment when our story closes, Heidi and Peter are sitting with grandmother.

The little girl has a lot of interesting things to share, and the others are trying so hard not to miss anything.

All summer long they have hardly met, and very many wonderful things have happened.

They are all glad at being together again.

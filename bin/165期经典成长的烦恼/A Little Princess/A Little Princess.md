A LITTLE PRINCESS( 公主 )

Once on a dark winter’s day, when the yellow fog hung thick and heavy in the streets of London, a strange-looking little girl sat in a cab with her father.

She sat, leaning( 倚靠 ) against him, as she stared out of the window with an old-fashioned thoughtfulness in her big eyes.

She was such a little girl that one did not expect to see such a look on her small face.

It would have been an old look for a child of twelve, and Sara Crewe was only seven.

The fact was, however, that she was always dreaming and thinking strange things.

At this moment she was remembering the journey she had just made from Bombay with her father, Captain Crewe.

She was thinking of the big ship, of the Lascars( 东印度水手 ) passing by on it, and of the children playing about on the hot deck( 甲板 ).

She was thinking of what a strange thing it was to travel so far from India.

They had been in the middle of the ocean, but now they were driving through strange streets.

“Papa,” she said in a low, mysterious( 神秘的 ) little voice.

“What is it, darling?”

Captain Crewe answered, looking down into her face.

“What is Sara thinking of?”

“Is this the place?” Sara whispered. “Is it, papa?”

“Yes, little Sara, it is. We have reached it at last.”

And though she was only seven years old, she knew that he felt sad when he said it.

It seemed to her many years since he had begun to prepare her mind for “the place,” as she always called it.

Her mother had died when she was born, so she had never known or missed her.

Her young, handsome, rich, father was the only relation she had in the world.

They had always been fond of each other.

She only knew he was rich because she had heard people say so.

She had also heard them say that when she grew up, she would be rich, too.

She did not know all that being rich meant.

She had always lived in a beautiful house, and had been used to seeing many servants who gave her her own way in everything.

She had had toys and pets and an ayah( 奶妈 ) who cared for her, and she began to understand that people who were rich had these things.

That, however, was all she knew about it.

During her short life only one thing had troubled her, and that thing was “the place” she was to be taken to someday.

The climate of India was very bad for children.

As soon as possible they were sent away from it—generally to England and to school.

She had seen other children go away, and had heard their fathers and mothers talk about the letters they received from them.

She had known that she would have to go also.

She had been troubled by the thought that her father could not stay with her.

“Couldn’t you go to that place with me, papa?” she had asked when she was five years old.

“But you will not have to stay for a very long time, little Sara,” he had always said.

“You will go to a nice house where there will be a lot of little girls, and you will play together.

I will send you plenty of books.

You will grow so fast.

It will seem like less than a year before you are big enough and clever enough to come back and take care of me.”

She had liked to think of that.

To keep the house for her father, to care for and spend time with him and his friends—that would be what she would like most in the world.

If one must go away to “the place” in England to do it, she must make up her mind to go.

She did not care very much for other little girls, but if she had plenty of books she could comfort herself.

She liked books more than anything else, and was, in fact, always inventing stories and telling them to herself.

“Well, papa,” she said softly, “if we are here I suppose we must be resigned( 听天由命的 ).”

He laughed at her old-fashioned speech and kissed her.

He was really not at all resigned himself, though he knew he must keep that a secret.

His little Sara had been a great companion( 同伴 ) to him, and he felt he should be lonely without her.

So he held her closely in his arms as the cab reached their destination( 目的地 ).

It was a big, brick( 砖砌的 ) house in a big, dull( 沉闷的 ) square.

On the front door there shone a brass plate( 黄铜名牌 ) which read:

MISS MINCHIN,

Select School for Young Ladies.
<hr>
“Here we are, Sara,” said Captain Crewe, making his voice sound cheerful.

Then he lifted her out of the cab and they went up the steps and rang the bell.

The drawing room into which they entered was covered by a carpet( 地毯 ) with a square pattern( 图案 ) upon it.

The chairs were square, and a heavy marble( 大理石的 ) clock stood upon the heavy marble mantel( 壁炉架 ) above the fireplace.

As she sat down in one of the stiff( 硬邦邦的 ) wooden chairs, Sara cast a quick look about her.

“I don’t like it, papa,” she said. “But then I would say soldiers—even brave ones—don’t really like going into battle.”

Captain Crewe laughed at this.

He was young and full of fun, and he was never tired of hearing Sara’s strange speeches.

“Oh, little Sara,” he said, “what shall I do when I have no one to say serious things to me? No one else is as serious as you are.”

“But why do serious things make you laugh so?” asked Sara.

“Because you are such fun when you say them,” he answered.

Suddenly he swept her into his arms and kissed her very hard.

But then he stopped laughing all at once and looked almost as if tears had come into his eyes.

It was just then that Miss Minchin entered the room.

She was very like her house, Sara felt: tall and boring, respectable and ugly.

She had cold, fishy( 呆滞的 ) eyes, and a cold, fishy smile.

It spread itself into a large smile when she saw Sara and Captain Crewe.

She had heard that he was a rich father who was willing to spend a great deal of money on his little daughter.

“It will be a great privilege( 荣幸 ) to have charge of such a beautiful and promising( 前途无量的 ) child, Captain Crewe,” she said.

She took Sara’s hand and stroked( 轻抚 ) it.

“Lady Meredith has told me of her unusual cleverness.

A clever child is a great treasure in a school like mine.”

Sara stood quietly, with her eyes fixed upon Miss Minchin’s face.

She was thinking something strange, as usual.

“Why does she say I am a beautiful child?” she was thinking.

“I am not beautiful at all.

I have short black hair and green eyes.

I am one of the ugliest children I ever saw.

She is beginning by telling a lie.”

She was mistaken, however, in thinking she was an ugly child.

She had an unusual charm( 魅力 ) of her own.

She was a small child, but rather tall for her age, and had an intense( 热情的 ), attractive little face.

Her hair was heavy and black; her eyes were greenish gray, it is true, but they were big, wonderful eyes with long, black eyelashes( 睫毛 ).

Still she was very firm in her belief that she was an ugly little girl.

She was not at all pleased by Miss Minchin’s praise.

After she had known Miss Minchin longer, Sara discovered that she said the same thing to each father and mother who brought a child to her school.

Sara stood near her father and listened while he and Miss Minchin talked.

She had been brought to the school because Lady Meredith’s two little girls had been educated there.

Captain Crewe had a great respect for Lady Meredith’s experience.

Sara was to be what was known as “a parlor boarder( 特别寄宿生 ),” and she was to enjoy even greater privileges than parlor boarders usually did.

She was to have a pretty bedroom and sitting room of her own; she was to have a pony( 小马驹 ) and a carriage( 马车 ), and a maid( 女仆 ).

“I am not worried about her education,” Captain Crewe said, as he held Sara’s hand.

“The difficulty will be to keep her from learning too fast and too much.

She is always sitting with her little nose in books.

She is always starving for( 渴望 ) new books.

She wants great, big grown-up books—French and German as well as English—history, poetry, and all sorts of things.

Drag her away from her books when she reads too much.

Make her ride her pony or go out and buy a new doll.

She ought to play more with dolls.”

“Papa,” said Sara, “if I went out and bought a new doll every few days, I should have more than I could be fond of.

Dolls ought to be close friends. Emily is going to be my close friend.”

“Who is Emily?” Miss Minchin asked.

“Tell her, Sara,” Captain Crewe said, smiling.

“She is a doll that papa is going to buy for me,” she said.

“We are going out together to find her.

I have called her Emily.

She is going to be my friend when papa is gone.”

Miss Minchin’s large, fishy smile grew even more.

“What an original child!” she said.

“What a darling little creature!”

“Yes,” said Captain Crewe, drawing Sara close.

“She is a darling little creature.

Take great care of her for me, Miss Minchin.”
<hr>
Sara stayed with her father at his hotel for several days until he sailed away again to India.

They went out and visited many shops together, and bought a great many things.

They bought, indeed, a great many more things than Sara needed.

Captain Crewe was a foolish, innocent young man and wanted his little girl to have everything she admired, and everything he admired himself.

Between them they collected a wardrobe( 衣柜 ) much too grand for a child of seven.

There were velvet( 天鹅绒的 ) and lace( 蕾丝 ) dresses, and hats with great, soft bird feathers, coats, and boxes of tiny gloves and handkerchiefs( 手帕 ) and silk stockings( 长袜 ).

And at last they found Emily.

They had passed two or three places without even going in.

Then, as they were approaching a rather small shop, Sara suddenly started and touched her father’s arm.

“Oh, papa!” she cried. “There is Emily!”

There was an expression in her green-gray eyes as if she had just seen someone she was fond of.

“She is actually waiting there for us!” she said.

“Let us go in to her.”

She was a large doll, but not too large to carry about easily.

She had naturally curling( 卷曲的 ) golden brown hair.

Her eyes were gray-blue, with soft, thick eyelashes which were real eyelashes and not mere painted lines.

“Of course,” said Sara, looking into her face as she held her on her knee, “of course papa, this is Emily.”

So Emily was bought and taken to a children’s outfitter’s shop and measured for a wardrobe as grand as Sara’s own.

She had lace and velvet dresses, too, and hats and coats and beautiful underwear( 内衣 ) and gloves and handkerchiefs and furs.

Captain Crewe would really have enjoyed the shopping, but that a sad thought kept pulling at his heart.

This all meant that he was going to be separated from his beloved( 心爱的 ) little companion.

He got out of his bed in the middle of that night and stood looking down at Sara, who lay asleep with Emily in her arms.

“Little Sara!” he said to himself.

“I don’t believe you know how much your daddy will miss you.”

The next day he took her to Miss Minchin’s and left her there.

He was to sail away the next morning.

He explained to Miss Minchin that his lawyers, Mr. Barrow and Mr. Skipworth, had charge of his affairs in England.

They would pay the bills she sent in for Sara’s expenses.

He would write to Sara twice a week, and she was to be given every pleasure she asked for.

“She is a wise little thing, and she always knows what is best for her well-being,” he said.

Then he went with Sara into her little sitting room and they said goodbye.

Sara sat on his knee and held onto the front of his coat in her small hands, and looked long and hard at his face.

“Are you learning me by heart, little Sara?” he said, touching her hair.

“No,” she answered.

“I know you by heart. You are inside my heart.”

And they put their arms round each other as if they would never let each other go.

After the cab had driven away with Captain Crewe in it, Miss Minchin sent her sister, Miss Amelia, to see what the child was doing.

Amelia found she could not open the door.

“I have locked it,” said a polite little voice from inside.

“I want to be by myself, if you please.”

Miss Amelia was fat and short, and stood very afraid of her sister.

She was the more agreeable person of the two, but she never disobeyed( 违背 ) Miss Minchin.

She went downstairs again, looking almost alarmed.

“I never saw such a funny, old-fashioned child, sister,” she said.

“She has locked herself in, and she is not making any noise.”

“It is much better than if she kicked and screamed, as some of them do,” Miss Minchin answered.

“I expected that a child as much spoiled( 被宠坏的 ) as she is would make quite a scene.

If ever a child was given her own way in everything, she is.”

“I’ve been opening her trunks and putting her things away,” said Miss Amelia.

“I never saw anything like them.

You have seen some of her clothes.

What do you think of them?”

“I think they are perfectly ridiculous( 可笑的 ),” replied Miss Minchin.

“But they will look very well at the head of the line when we take the children to church on Sunday.

She has been provided for as if she were a little princess.”

And upstairs( 在楼上 ) in the locked room Sara and Emily sat on the floor.

She stared at the corner round which the cab had disappeared, while Captain Crewe looked back, waving and kissing his hand as if he could not bear to stop.
<hr>
When Sara entered the classroom the next morning everybody looked at her with interested eyes.

By that time every pupil had heard a great deal about her.

There was Lavinia Herbert, who was nearly thirteen and felt quite grown up, as well as Lottie Legh, who was only just four and the baby of the school.

They knew that she was Miss Minchin’s show pupil.

Lavinia had passed by Sara’s room when the door was open.

She had seen Mariette, Sara’s French maid, opening a box which had arrived late from the shop.

“It was full of dresses with expensive lace on them,” she whispered to her friend Jessie as she studied her geography.

“I heard Miss Minchin say to Miss Amelia that her clothes were so grand that they were silly for a child.”

Sara was sitting in her seat, waiting to be told what to do.

She had been placed near Miss Minchin’s desk.

She looked back quietly at the children who looked at her.

She wondered what they were thinking of, and if they liked Miss Minchin, and if any of them had a papa at all like her own.

She had had a long talk with Emily about her papa that morning.

“He is on the sea now, Emily,” she had said.

“We must be very great friends to each other.

Emily, look at me.

You have the nicest eyes I ever saw—but I wish you could speak.”

She was a child full of imagination, and one of her favorite things was pretending( 假装 ) that Emily was alive and really heard and understood.

After Mariette had dressed her in her dark blue classroom dress, she went to Emily, who sat in a chair of her own.

Sara gave her a book.

“You can read that while I am downstairs( 在楼下 ),” she said.

Seeing Mariette looking at her curiously, she spoke to her with a serious little face.

“What I believe about dolls,” she said, “is that they can do things they will not let us know about.

Perhaps, really, Emily can read and talk and walk, but she will only do it when people are out of the room. That is her secret.”

Mariette liked this unusual little girl who had such an intelligent small face and such perfect manners.

She had taken care of children who were not so polite before.

Sara was a very fine person.

She had a gentle way of saying, “If you please, Mariette,” “Thank you, Mariette,” which was very pleasant.

Indeed, Mariette was very much pleased with her new little employer and liked her place greatly.

After Sara had sat in her seat in the classroom for a few minutes, Miss Minchin knocked in a serious manner upon her desk.

“Young ladies,” she said, “I wish to introduce you to your new companion, Miss Crewe.

She has just come to us from a great distance—from India.

As soon as lessons are over you must introduce yourselves.”

“Sara,” said Miss Minchin in her classroom manner, “come here to me.”

She had taken a book from the desk and was turning over its leaves.

Sara went to her politely.

“Your papa has chosen a French maid for you,” she began.

“Therefore, I conclude( 推断 ) that he wishes you to make a special study of the French language.”

Sara felt a little awkward( 尴尬的 ).

“I think he chose her,” she said, “because he—he thought I would like her, Miss Minchin.”

“I am afraid,” said Miss Minchin, with a slightly sour smile, “that you have been a very spoiled little girl, and always imagine that things are done because you like them.

My impression is that your papa wished you to learn French.”

If Sara had been older or less careful about being quite polite to people, she could have explained herself in a very few words.

But, as it was, she felt color rising in her cheeks.

Miss Minchin was a very serious and frightening person.

She seemed so sure that Sara knew nothing of French that Sara felt as if it would be almost rude to correct her.

The truth was that Sara could not remember the time when she had not seemed to know French.

Her father had often spoken it to her when she had been a baby.

Her mother had been a French woman, and Captain Crewe had loved her language.

So Sara had always heard and understood it.

“I—I have never really learned French, but—but—” she began, trying shyly to make herself clear.

One of Miss Minchin’s chief secret annoyances( 烦恼 ) was that she did not speak French herself.

“That is enough,” she said with polite bitterness.

“If you have not learned, you must begin at once.

The French master, Monsieur Dufarge, will be here in a few minutes.

Take this book and look at it until he arrives.”

Sara’s cheeks felt warm.

She went back to her seat and opened the book.

She looked at the first page with a stony face.

Miss Minchin looked toward her.

“You look rather cross( 生气的 ), Sara,” she said.

“I am sorry you do not like the idea of learning French.”

“I am very fond of it,” answered Sara, thinking she would try again, “but—”

“You must not say ‘but’ when you are told to do things,” said Miss Minchin.

“Look at your book again.”

And Sara did so.

“When Monsieur Dufarge comes,” she thought, “I can make him understand.”
<hr>
Monsieur Dufarge arrived very soon after.

He was a very nice, middle-aged Frenchman.

“Is this a new pupil for me, madame( 【法】夫人 )?” he said to Miss Minchin, when he saw Sara.

“Her papa—Captain Crewe—wants her to begin the language.

But I am afraid she does not seem to wish to learn,” said Miss Minchin.

“I am sorry of that, mademoiselle( 【法】小姐 ),” he said kindly to Sara.

“Perhaps, when we begin to study together, I may show you that it is a wonderful language.”

Little Sara rose in her seat.

She knew that he would understand as soon as she spoke.

She began to explain in fluent( 流利的 ) French.

She had not learned French exactly—not out of books—but her papa had always spoken it to her.

She had read it and written it as she had read and written English.

Her dear mamma, who had died when she was born, had been French.

She would be glad to learn anything monsieur( 【法】先生 ) would teach her, but what she had tried to explain was that she already knew the words in this book.

She held out the little book of phrases.

When she began to speak, Miss Minchin started quite suddenly and sat staring at her over her eyeglasses until she had finished.

Monsieur Dufarge began to smile.

To hear this pretty childish voice speaking his own language made him feel almost as if he were in his own country.

When she had finished, he spoke to Miss Minchin.

“Ah, madame,” he said, “there is not much I can teach her.

She has not learned French; she is French. Her accent is perfect.”

“You ought to have told me,” cried out Miss Minchin, much ashamed, turning to Sara.

“I—I tried,” said Sara. “I—I suppose I did not begin right.”

Miss Minchin knew she had tried, and that it had not been her fault that she was not allowed to explain. And when she saw that the pupils had been listening and that Lavinia and Jessie were laughing she felt very angry.

“Silence, young ladies!” she said strictly. “Silence at once!”

And from that minute she began to feel rather a dislike for her show pupil.

On that first morning, when Sara sat at Miss Minchin’s side, Sara noticed one little girl, about her own age, who looked at her very hard with a pair of light blue eyes.

She was a fat child who did not look as if she were in the least clever.

Her yellow hair hung down in a tight braid( 发辫 ), tied with a ribbon( 缎带 ).

She had pulled this braid around her neck, and was biting the end of the ribbon, as she looked wonderingly at the new pupil.

When Sara stepped forward and answered Monsieur Dufarge in French, the little girl grew quite red in surprise.

She had cried hopeless tears for weeks in her efforts to remember that “la mère” meant “the mother,” and “le père” meant “the father.”

It was almost too much for her to listen to a child of her own age who was not only familiar with these words, but knew many others.

She looked so hard and bit the ribbon on her braid so fast that she attracted the attention of Miss Minchin.

The woman, who was feeling extremely cross at the moment, immediately set upon her.

“Miss St. John!” she cried out.

“What do you mean by such conduct? Take your ribbon out of your mouth! Sit up at once!”

Lavinia and Jessie laughed quietly, and Ermengarde became redder than ever.

She was so red, indeed, that she almost looked as if tears were coming into her eyes.

Sara saw her and was so sorry for her that she began to like her and want to be her friend. It was Sara’s way to always want to help someone who was made uncomfortable or unhappy.

So she took rather a liking to little Miss St. John.

She saw that lessons were no easy matter to her.

Her French lesson was a hopeless thing.

Her accent made even Monsieur Dufarge smile even though he did not want to.

Lavinia and Jessie and the more fortunate girls laughed at her. But Sara did not laugh.

When lessons were over, Sara looked for Miss St. John.

Finding her in a window seat, she walked over to her and spoke.

“What is your name?” she said.

“My name’s Ermengarde St. John,” she answered.

“Mine is Sara Crewe,” said Sara.

“Yours is very pretty. It sounds like a story book.”

“Do you like it?” said Ermengarde nervously. “I—I like yours.”

Miss St. John’s chief trouble in life was that she had a clever father.

Her father could speak seven or eight languages, and had thousands of books which he had almost learned by heart.

As a result, he often expected his daughter to be familiar with the contents of her lesson books at least.

Ermengarde was a difficult problem for Mr. St. John.

He could not understand how a child of his could be a notably dull( 迟钝的 ) girl who never shone in anything.

Consequently, Ermengarde spent the greater part of her life in trouble or in tears.

She learned things and forgot them, or, if she remembered them, she did not understand them.

So it was natural that, having met Sara, she should sit and stare at her with great admiration.
<hr>
“You can speak French, can’t you?” she said respectfully.

Sara sat next to her on the window seat.

“I can speak it because I have heard it all my life,” she answered.

“You could speak it if you had always heard it.”

Ermengarde paused a moment, and then added with a touch of wonder in her voice, “You are clever, aren’t you?”

Sara looked out of the window and thought for a few moments.

She had heard it said very often that she was “clever,” and she wondered if she was.

“I don’t know,” she said. “I can’t tell.”

Then, seeing a sad look on the round face, she gave a little laugh and changed the subject.

“Would you like to see Emily?” she asked.

“Who is Emily?” Ermengarde asked, just as Miss Minchin had done.

“Come up to my room and see,” said Sara, holding out her hand.

They jumped down from the window seat together, and went upstairs.

“Is it true,” Ermengarde whispered, as they went through the hall—“is it true that you have a playroom( 娱乐室 ) all to yourself?”

“Yes,” Sara answered.

“Papa asked Miss Minchin to let me have one, because when I play I make up stories and tell them to myself.

I don’t like people to hear me.”

“You make up stories!” Ermengarde said with surprise.

“Can you do that—as well as speak French? Can you?”

“Why, anyone can make up things,” she said. “Have you never tried?”

She put her hand on Ermengarde’s.

“Let us go very quietly to the door,” she whispered, “and then I will open it quite suddenly; perhaps we may catch her.”

Ermengarde did not have any idea what it meant, or whom it was she wanted to “catch,” or why she wanted to catch her.

Whatever she meant, Ermengarde was sure it was something exciting.

They made not the least noise until they reached the door.

Then Sara suddenly turned the handle, and threw it wide open.

They saw the quiet room, and a wonderful doll sitting in a chair, who appeared to be reading a book.

“Oh, she got back to her seat before we could see her!” Sara explained.

“Of course they always do. They are as quick as lightning.”

Ermengarde looked from her to the doll and back again.

“Can she—walk?” she asked excitedly.

“Yes,” answered Sara.

“At least I pretend she can. Have you never pretended things?”

“No,” said Ermengarde. “Never. I—tell me about it.”

“Let us sit down,” said Sara, “and I will tell you. It’s so easy that when you begin you can’t stop.

You just go on and on doing it always.

And it’s beautiful. Emily, you must listen.

This is Ermengarde St. John, Emily.

Ermengarde, this is Emily.

Would you like to hold her?”

“Oh, may I?” said Ermengarde. “May I, really? She is beautiful!”

And Emily was put into her arms.

Miss St. John had never in her short life dreamed of such an hour as the one she spent with the new pupil.

But then they heard the lunch bell ring and had to go downstairs.

When the two girls spent time together, Sara would sit upon the carpet and tell her strange things.

She told stories of the voyage, and stories of India.

What interested Ermengarde the most, however, was her idea about the dolls who walked and talked.

They could do anything they chose when the humans were out of the room, but they must keep their powers a secret.

So they would fly back to their places “like lightning” when people returned to the room.

Once, when she was relating the story of the search for Emily, Ermengarde saw her face suddenly change.

A cloud seemed to pass over it and put out the light in her shining eyes.

She drew her breath in so quickly that it made a sad little sound.

“Do you have a—a pain?” Ermengarde asked.

“Yes,” Sara answered, after a moment’s silence.

“But it is not in my body.”

Then she added something in a low voice: “Do you love your father more than anything else in all the whole world?”

Ermengarde’s mouth fell open a little.

“I—I hardly ever see him,” she said. “He is always in the library—reading things.”

“I love mine more than all the world ten times over,” Sara said.

“That is what my pain is. He has gone away.”

“She’s going to cry out loud,” thought Ermengarde, fearfully.

But she did not.

“I promised him I would bear it,” she said.

“And I will. You have to bear things. Think what soldiers bear! Papa is a soldier.

If there was a war he would have to bear marching and thirstiness and, perhaps, deep wounds.

And he would never say a word—not one word.”

Ermengarde felt that she was beginning to like her quite a lot.

She was so wonderful and different from anyone else.

“Lavinia and Jessie are ‘best friends,’ ” Ermengarde said.

“I wish we could be ‘best friends.’ Would you have me for yours?

You’re clever, and I’m the stupidest child in the school, but I—oh, I do so like you!”

“I’m glad of that,” said Sara.

“Yes. We will be friends.

And I’ll tell you what”—her face lit up suddenly—“I can help you with your French lessons.”
<hr>
If Sara had been a different kind of child, the life she led at Miss Minchin’s Select School for the next few years would have been bad for her.

She was treated more as if she were a special guest than as if she were a mere little girl.

If she had been a spoiled child, she might have become unbearable to others through being treated so nicely.

Privately Miss Minchin disliked her, but she would not do anything which might make such a desirable( 合意的 ) pupil wish to leave her school.

She knew quite well that if Sara wrote to her papa to tell him she was unhappy, Captain Crewe would take her away at once.

Miss Minchin’s opinion was that if a child were continually praised and always did what she liked, she would be sure to be fond of the place where she was treated so.

Accordingly, Sara was praised for her quickness at her lessons, for her good manners, and for her generosity if she gave sixpence( 六便士 ) to a beggar.

If she had not had a clever little brain, she might have been a very self-satisfied young person.

But the clever little brain told her a great many wise things about her situation.

Now and then she talked these things over to Ermengarde.

“Things happen to people by accident,” she used to say.

“A lot of nice accidents have happened to me.

It just happened that I was born with a father who was nice, and could give me everything I liked.

If you have everything you want and everyone is kind to you, how can you help but be well-mannered?

Perhaps I’m a terrible child, and no one will ever know, just because I never have any problems.”

“Lavinia has no problems,” said Ermengarde, “and she is terrible enough.”

Lavinia, in fact, was jealous( 嫉妒的 ) of Sara.

Until the new pupil’s arrival, she had felt herself the leader in the school.

She had led because she could make herself extremely disagreeable if the others did not follow her.

She was rather pretty, and had been the best-dressed pupil in the Select School until Sara appeared.

This, at the beginning, had been bad enough.

As time went on, however, it became clear that Sara was a leader, too, and not because she could make herself disagreeable, but because she never did.

“There’s one thing about Sara Crewe,” Jessie had once angered her “best friend” by saying honestly.

“She’s never ‘grand’ about herself the least bit, and you know she might be, Lavvie.

I believe I couldn’t help being grand—just a little—if I had so many fine things and people paid such attention to me.

It’s sickening, the way Miss Minchin shows her off when parents come.”

It was quite true that Sara was never “grand.”

She was a friendly little soul, and shared her belongings with a free hand.

She was a motherly young person, and when people fell down and hurt their knees, she helped them up and comforted them.

So the younger children loved Sara.

Lottie Legh especially looked up to her.

Lottie had been sent to school by a rather young papa who could not imagine what else to do with her.

Her young mother had died, and the child had always been treated like a very spoiled pet.

She was a very difficult little girl.

When she wanted anything or did not want anything she cried and shouted.

Lottie had found out that a very small girl who had lost her mother was a person who ought to be pitied.

This became her strongest weapon( 武器 ).

She had probably heard some grown-up people talking her over in the early days, after her mother’s death.

So it became her habit to make great use of this knowledge.

One morning when passing a sitting room, Sara heard both Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia trying to stop Lottie’s angry cries.

“What is she crying for?” Miss Minchin yelled( 大叫 ) over her.

“Oh—oh—oh!” Sara heard. “I don’t have any mam—ma-a!”

“Oh, Lottie!” screamed Miss Amelia.

“Do stop, darling! Don’t cry! Please don’t!”

“She ought to be whipped( 被鞭打 ),” Miss Minchin said.

“You shall be whipped, you awful child!”

Lottie cried more loudly than ever.

Miss Amelia began to cry.

Miss Minchin’s voice rose until it almost thundered.

Then suddenly she sprang up from her chair and left the room, leaving Miss Amelia to fix the matter.

Sara had paused in the hall, wondering if she should go into the room.

She had recently begun to be friendly with Lottie and might be able to quiet her.

When Miss Minchin came out and saw her, she looked rather annoyed.

She realized that her voice, as heard from inside the room, could not have sounded respectable.

“Oh, Sara!” she said, trying to smile.

“I stopped,” explained Sara, “because I knew it was Lottie—and I thought, perhaps—just perhaps, I could make her be quiet. May I try, Miss Minchin?”

“If you can, you are a clever child,” answered Miss Minchin, drawing in her mouth coldly.

“I suppose you can manage her. Go in.”

And she left her.
<hr>
When Sara entered the room, Lottie was lying upon the floor, screaming and kicking.

Lottie had always found, when in her own nursery at home, that the adults would do anything to make her stop kicking and screaming.

Poor Miss Amelia was trying first one method, and then another.

“Poor darling,” she said one moment.

“I know you don’t have any mamma, poor—” Then in quite another manner, she would say,

“If you don’t stop, Lottie, I will shake you. Poor little angel( 天使 )!”

Sara went to them quietly.

She did not know at all what she was going to do, but she felt that it would be better not to say such different things quite so helplessly( 无可奈何地 ) and excitedly.

“Miss Amelia,” she said in a low voice, “Miss Minchin says I may try to make her stop—may I?”

Miss Amelia turned and looked at her hopelessly.

“Oh, do you think you can?” she asked.

“I don’t know whether I can”, answered Sara, still in her half whisper, “but I will try. If you will steal out of the room, I will stay with her.”

Miss Amelia went quietly out of the room, and was very much relieved to find an excuse for doing so.

Sara stood by the crying child for a few moments, and looked down at her without saying anything.

Then she sat down flat on the floor beside her and waited. Except for Lottie’s angry screams, the room was quite quiet.

This was a new experience for little Miss Legh, who was used to hearing other people try to stop her when she screamed.

To kick and cry, and find the only person near you not seeming to mind, got Lottie’s attention.

She opened her tight shut streaming eyes to see who this person was.

It was the little girl who owned Emily and all the nice things.

She had stopped for a few seconds to find this out, so Lottie thought she must begin again.

The quiet of the room and of Sara’s interested face, however, made her first cry out rather half-hearted( 半心半意的 ).

“I—don’t have—any—ma—ma—ma-a!” Lottie said.

Sara looked at her with a sort of understanding in her eyes.

“Neither do I,” she said.

This was so unexpected that Lottie actually dropped her legs, and stared.

A new idea will stop a crying child when nothing else will.

Also it was true that while Lottie disliked Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia, she rather liked Sara.

After another sad cry, she said, “Where is she?”

“She went to heaven,” Sara said.

“But I am sure she comes out sometimes to see me—though I don’t see her. So does yours.

Perhaps they can both see us now. Perhaps they are both in this room.”

Lottie sat up quickly, and looked about her.

If her mamma had seen her during the last half hour, she might not have thought her the kind of child who ought to be related to an angel.

Sara went on talking.

Perhaps some people might think that what she said was like a fairy( 虚构的 ) story, but it was so real that Lottie began to listen despite her sadness.

“There are fields and fields of flowers,” she said, talking rather as if she were in a dream.

“And when the soft wind blows over them, it carries the smell of them into the air.

Everybody always breathes it, because the soft wind is always blowing.

And little children run about in the fields and pick the flowers, and laugh and make little wreaths( 花冠 ).

And the streets are shining.

And people are never tired, however far they walk.”

Lottie stopped crying, listening with interest.

She moved closer to Sara, and drank in every word until Sara finished.

“I want to go there,” Lottie cried again.

“I—don’t have any mamma in this school.”

Sara took hold of Lottie’s hand and pulled her close to her side.

“I will be your mamma,” she said.

“We will play that you are my little girl. And Emily shall be your sister.”

“Shall she?” Lottie said.

“Yes,” answered Sara, jumping to her feet.

“Let us go and tell her. And then I will wash your face and brush your hair.”

Lottie agreed quite cheerfully.

She did not seem to remember the issue of the last hour.

Actually, it had been caused by the fact that she had refused to be washed and brushed for lunch.

And from that time Sara was an adopted mother( 养母 ).

The greatest power Sara had was her power of telling stories.

She could make everything she talked about seem like a story, whether it was one or not.

Sara not only could tell stories, but she loved telling them.

When she sat or stood in the middle of a circle and began to invent wonderful things, her green eyes grew big and shining, and her cheeks reddened.

She began to act, making her story lovely or alarming by raising or dropping her voice and moving her hands.
<hr>
She had been at Miss Minchin’s school about two years.

On one foggy winter’s afternoon, Sara was sitting in the middle of a group in the classroom telling one of her stories.

A little servant girl quietly entered the room, carrying a coal box much too heavy for her.

She knelt( 跪下 ) down upon the carpet to fix the fire and sweep up the ashes.

She was afraid to look at the children or seem to be listening.

But Sara saw in two minutes that she was deeply interested in what was going on.

The girl was doing her work slowly in the hope of catching a word here and there.

Realizing this, Sara raised her voice and spoke more clearly.

“The Mermaids( 美人鱼 ) swam softly about in the clear green water, and dragged after them a fishing net made of deep-sea pearls( 珍珠 ),” she said.

“The Princess sat on the white rock and watched them.”

It was a wonderful story about a princess who was loved by a Prince Merman( 人鱼王子 ), and lived with him in shining caves under the sea.

The small servant swept the fireplace once and then swept it again.

Having done it twice, she did it three times.

As she was doing it the third time, the sound of the story so moved her to listen that she fell under the spell.

She sat down upon her heels as she knelt on the carpet, and the brush hung unused in her fingers.

The voice of the storyteller( 讲故事的人 ) drew her into the story.

The brush fell from the girl’s rough hand, and Lavinia Herbert looked round.

“That girl has been listening,” she said.

The servant quickly picked up her brush, and jumped to her feet.

She caught at the coal box and simply ran out of the room like a frightened rabbit.

Sara felt rather angry at Lavinia.

“I knew she was listening,” she said. “Why shouldn’t she?”

Lavinia shook her head with great elegance( 高雅 ).

“Well,” she answered, “I do not know whether your mamma would like you to tell stories to servant girls.

I know my mamma wouldn’t like me to do it.”

“My mamma!” said Sara, looking confused( 困惑的 ).

“I don’t believe she would mind in the least. She knows that stories belong to everybody.”

“I thought,” answered Lavinia unkindly, “that your mamma was dead. How can she know things?”

“Do you think she doesn’t know things?” said Sara, in her serious little voice.

Without waiting for a response, Sara marched out of the room.

She hoped that she might see the servant again, but she did not see her when she got into the hall.

“Who is that little girl who makes the fires?” she asked Mariette that night.

Mariette answered that she was a sad little thing who had just taken the place of scullery( 洗碗的 ) maid, but she was everything else besides.

She cleaned boots and fireplaces, and carried heavy coal boxes up and down stairs.

She cleaned floors and windows, and was ordered about by everybody.

She was fourteen years old, but was so small in size that she looked about twelve.

“What is her name?” asked Sara.

Her name was Becky.

Mariette heard everyone below stairs calling, “Becky, do this,” and “Becky, do that,” every five minutes in the day.

Sara sat and looked into the fire, thinking on Becky for some time after Mariette left her.

She thought the servant girl looked as if she had never had quite enough to eat.

Her very eyes were hungry.

She hoped she should see her again.

Sadly, Becky always seemed in such a hurry and so afraid of being seen that it was impossible to speak to her.

A few weeks later, on another foggy afternoon, when Sara entered her sitting room she found herself looking at a rather sad picture.

Becky was sitting in Sara’s own special easy chair before the bright fire.

There was a coal mark on her nose and several on her clothing, with her little cap hanging half off her head, and an empty coal box on the floor near her.

She was fast asleep, tired out beyond the strength of her hard-working young body.

She had been sent up to put the bedrooms in order for the evening.

She had really been only about ten minutes in the room when Sara entered, but she was in a very deep sleep.

“Oh!” cried Sara, softly, when she saw her.

“That poor thing!”

She wondered what it would be best to do.

Miss Amelia might come in at any moment, and if she did, Becky would be sure to be punished.

“But she is so tired,” she thought.

A piece of coal from the fire broke off from a large piece and fell on to the bottom of the fireplace.

Becky started, and opened her eyes with a frightened breath.

She did not know she had fallen asleep.

She had only sat down for one moment and felt the beautiful warmth.

Now here she found herself looking in fear at the pupil, who sat quite near her with interested eyes.
<hr>
She sprang up.

Oh, she had got herself into deep trouble now!

To have fallen asleep on such a young lady’s chair!

She would be turned out of doors without her money.

“Oh, miss! Oh, miss!” she said nervously.

“I ask your pardon, miss! Oh, I do, miss!”

Sara jumped down, and came quite close to her.

“Don’t be frightened,” she said.

“It doesn’t matter the least bit.”

“I didn’t go to do it, miss,” said Becky.

“It was the warm fire—and I was so tired.”

Sara broke into a friendly little laugh, and put her hand on her shoulder.

“You were tired,” she said, “you could not help it.”

How poor Becky stared at her!

In fact, she had never heard such a friendly sound in anyone’s voice before.

She was used to being ordered about and punished, and having her ears boxed.

“Aren’t you angry, miss?” she asked fearfully.

“Aren’t you going to tell the missus( 太太 )?”

“No,” cried out Sara.

“Of course I’m not.”

The fright( 惊吓 ) in the coal-stained face made her suddenly so sorry that she could hardly bear it.

She put her hand against Becky’s cheek.

“Why,” she said, “we are just the same—I am only a little girl like you. It’s just an accident that I am not you, and you are not me!”

Becky did not understand in the least.

“An accident, miss,” she said. “Is it?”

“Yes,” Sara answered, and she looked at her for a moment like she was in a dream.

But then she spoke in a different way.

She realized that Becky did not know what she meant.

“Have you done your work?” she asked.

“Can you stay here a few minutes?”

“Here, miss? Me?”

Sara ran to the door, opened it, and looked out and listened.

“No one is anywhere about,” she explained.

“Perhaps you might stay a tiny while.

I thought—perhaps—you might like a piece of cake.”

Sara gave her a thick piece of cake.

She was happy when it was eaten in hungry bites.

She talked and asked questions, and laughed until Becky’s fears actually began to calm themselves.

“Becky,” she said, “weren’t you listening to that story?”

“Yes, miss,” admitted Becky, a little alarmed again.

“I know I shouldn’t have, but it was so beautiful, I—I couldn’t help it.”

“I liked you to listen to it,” said Sara.

“Would you like to hear the rest?”

“Me hear it?” she cried.

“Like as if I was a pupil, miss!”

Sara nodded.

“You don’t have time to hear it now, I’m afraid,” she said.

“But if you will tell me just what time you come to do my rooms, I will try to be here.

I can tell you a bit of it every day until it is finished.”

“Then,” said Becky, “I wouldn’t mind how heavy the coal boxes were—or what the cook has done to me, if—if I might have that to think of.”

“You may,” said Sara. “I’ll tell it all to you.”

When Becky went downstairs, she was not the same tired Becky who had come up.

She had another piece of cake in her pocket, and she had been fed( 被喂饱 ) and warmed, but not only by cake and fire.

Something else had warmed and fed her, and the something else was Sara.

Not very long after this a very exciting thing happened.

Not only Sara, but the entire school, found it exciting, and talked about it for weeks.

In one of his letters, Captain Crewe told a most interesting story.

A friend who had been at school with him had unexpectedly come to see him in India.

He was the owner of a large piece of land upon which diamonds had been found, and he was involved in developing the mines.

If all went as was expected, he would have so much wealth that it made one dizzy( 晕眩的 ) to think of.

Because he was fond of Captain Crewe, the school friend had given him an opportunity to share in this huge fortune by becoming a partner in his plan.

This, at least, was what Sara understood from his letters.

It is true that any other business plan, however grand, would have had small attraction for her or for the classroom.

“Diamond mines,” however, sounded so like the Arabian Nights( 天方夜谭 ) that everyone was interested.

Sara painted pictures, for Ermengarde and Lottie, of passages deep in the earth, where shining stones lined the walls and roofs, and men dug them out with picks.

Ermengarde delighted in the story, and Lottie insisted on its being retold to her every evening.

Lavinia was very mean about it, and told Jessie that she didn’t believe such things as diamond mines existed.

“I believe you hate her,” said Jessie.

“No, I don’t,” said Lavinia quickly.

“But I don’t believe in mines full of diamonds.”

“Well, people have to get them from somewhere.

If she does, she’ll be as rich as the royal family.” said Jessie.

“Oh, Lavinia,” with a new little laugh, “I heard that one of Sara’s ‘pretends’ is that she is a princess.

She plays it all the time—even in school.

She says it makes her learn her lessons better.

She wants Ermengarde to be one, too, but Ermengarde says she is too fat.”

“She is too fat,” said Lavinia, “and Sara is too thin.”

Naturally, Jessie laughed again.

“She says it has nothing to do with what you look like, or what you have.

It has only to do with what you think of, and what you do.”

“I suppose she thinks she could be a princess if she was a beggar,” said Lavinia.

“Let us begin to call her Your Royal Highness( 殿下 ).”
<hr>
Lessons for the day were over, and they were sitting before the classroom fire, enjoying the time they liked best.

At this hour a great deal of talking was done, and a great many secrets changed hands.

Even as Lavinia spoke, the door opened and Sara entered with Lottie, whose habit was to follow everywhere after her like a little dog.

“There she is, with that awful child!” said Lavinia in a whisper.

“She will begin crying about something in five minutes.”

Lottie joined a group of little ones who were playing in a corner.

Sara sat up in the window seat, opened a book, and began to read.

It was a book about the French Revolution( 法国大革命 ).

She was soon lost in the story of the prisoners in the Bastille( 巴士底狱 )—men who had spent so many years locked up in jail( 监狱 ).

Lottie had been sliding( 滑行 ) across the classroom floor, and had ended by falling down and hurting her fat knee.

She was screaming and dancing up and down in the middle of a group of friends and enemies.

They were both trying to make her feel better and to get her to be quiet.

“Stop this minute, you crybaby( 爱哭鬼 )! Stop this minute!” Lavinia commanded.

“I’m not a crybaby . . . I’m not!” said Lottie tearfully( 泪汪汪地 ). “Sara, Sa—ra!”

Sara flew across the room and, lowering herself, put her arms round her.

“Come and sit in the window seat with me,” Sara said, “and I’ll whisper a story to you.”

“Will you?” said Lottie through her tears.

“Will you—tell me—about the diamond mines?”

“The diamond mines?” broke out Lavinia.

“Nasty( 可恶的 ), little spoiled thing, I should like to hit her!”

Sara got up quickly on her feet.

She was not an angel, and she did not like Lavinia.

“Well,” she said, with some fire, “I should like to hit you—but I won’t hit you. We are both old enough to know better.”

Here was Lavinia’s opportunity.

“Ah, yes, your royal highness,” she said.

“We are princesses, I believe. At least one of us is.”

Sara started toward her.

She looked as if she were going to box Lavinia’s ears.

Perhaps she was.

Her trick of pretending things was the joy of her life.

She never spoke of it to girls she disliked.

She felt the blood rush up into her face and ring in her ears.

She only just saved herself. If you were a princess, you did not show that you were angry.

Her hand dropped, and she stood quite still a moment.

When she spoke, it was in a quiet voice; she held her head up, and everybody listened to her.

“It’s true,” she said.

“Sometimes I do pretend I am a princess, so that I can try and behave like one.”

“Dear me,” Lavinia said, “I hope, when you become a queen, you won’t forget us!”

“I won’t,” said Sara, and she looked at Lavinia firmly, until Lavinia took Jessie’s arm and turned away.

After this, the girls who were jealous of her called her “Princess Sara” whenever they wished to be unkind.

But those who were fond of her gave her the name as a term of love.

To Becky it seemed the most fitting thing in the world.

Their friendship had grown, though Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia knew very little about it.

They were aware that Sara was “kind” to the scullery maid.

But they knew nothing of certain delightful moments when, after Becky was done cleaning the upstairs rooms, she would come to Sara’s sitting room.

The heavy coal box was set down with a sigh of joy, and stories were told.

Food was either eaten or quickly put into pockets for later that night, when Becky went upstairs to her attic( 阁楼 ) to bed.

“But I must eat carefully, miss,” she said once, “because if I leave crumbs( 碎屑 ), the rats come out to get them.”

“Rats!” cried out Sara, in fear. “Are there rats there?”

“Lots of them, miss,” Becky answered in quite a matter-of-fact manner.

“There are rats and mice in attics. You get used to the noise they make when they move about.”

“Ugh!” said Sara.

“You get used to anything over time,” said Becky.

“You have to, miss, if you’re born a scullery maid. I’d rather have rats than cockroaches( 蟑螂 ).”

“So would I,” said Sara.

“I suppose you might make friends with a rat in time.

I don’t believe I should like to make friends with a cockroach.”

A few weeks before Sara’s eleventh birthday, a letter came to her from her father, which was not written in such high spirits as usual.

He was not very well, and was weighed down by the business of the diamond mines.

“You see, little Sara,” he wrote, “your daddy is not a businessman at all, and figures trouble him.

He does not really understand them, and all this seems so huge.

I have been feverish, turning about in bed one half of the night and the other half spent in troublesome dreams.

If my little missus were here, I know she would give me some serious, good advice.

You would, wouldn’t you, Little Missus?”

One of his many jokes had been to call her his “little missus” because she had such an old-fashioned air.
<hr>
He had made wonderful preparations for her birthday.

Among other things, a new doll had been ordered in Paris, and her wardrobe was to be beautiful.

When she had replied to the letter that asked her if the doll would be an acceptable present, Sara had been very thoughtful.

“I am getting very old,” she wrote, “I shall never have another doll given me.

This will be my last doll.

No one could ever take Emily’s place, but I should respect the Last Doll very much.”

Captain Crewe had a terrible headache when he read this letter in his house in India.

The table before him was covered with papers and letters.

They worried him and filled him with fear, but he laughed as he had not laughed for weeks.

“Oh,” he said, “I would give anything to have her little arms round my neck this minute! Anything!”

When Sara entered the holly-hung classroom in the afternoon of her birthday, Miss Minchin, in her most expensive silk dress, led her by the hand.

A servant followed, carrying the box containing( 装有 ) the Last Doll.

A housemaid( 女仆 ) carried a second box, and Becky was behind them, carrying a third box and wearing a clean dress.

Sara felt shy when, on her entry, the big girls stared at her, and the little ones began to turn happily in their seats.

“Silence, young ladies!” said Miss Minchin.

“James, place the box on the table and remove the lid( 盖子 ). Emma, put yours upon a chair. Becky! You may leave us.”

Miss Minchin turned away the servants with a wave of her hand.

Becky stepped aside respectfully to allow the higher servants to pass out first.

She could not help casting a longing glance at the box on the table.

“If you please, Miss Minchin,” said Sara, suddenly, “may Becky stay?”

It was a brave thing to do.

“I know she will like to see the presents,” she explained.

“She is a little girl, too, you know.”

Miss Minchin was displeased.

“My dear Sara,” she said, “Becky is the scullery maid. Scullery maids are not little girls.”

To Miss Minchin, scullery maids were machines who carried coal and made fires.

“But Becky is,” said Sara. “Please let her stay—because it is my birthday.”

Miss Minchin replied seriously:

“As you ask it as a birthday favor—she may stay.”

“Rebecca, go and stand there,” she said. “Not too near the young ladies.”

Becky went to her place, smiling widely.

She did not care where she was sent, as long as she might have the luck of being inside the room.

“Now, young ladies, I have a few words to say to you,” Miss Minchin announced.

“She’s going to make a speech,” whispered one of the girls. “I wish it was over.”

“You are aware, young ladies,” the speech began—for it was a speech—“that dear Sara is eleven years old today.”

“Several of you here have also been eleven years old, but Sara’s birthdays are rather different from other little girls’ birthdays.

When she is older she will be heiress( 女继承人 ) to a large fortune, which it will be her duty to spend in a generous manner.

Sara has become my most skilled pupil.

Her French and her dancing are a credit to( 为...增光的人或物 ) the school.

Her manners—which have caused you to call her Princess Sara—are perfect.

She shows her goodness by giving you this afternoon’s party.

I hope you appreciate her generosity.

I wish you to express your appreciation of it by saying aloud all together, ‘Thank you, Sara!’ ”

The entire classroom rose to its feet.

“Thank you, Sara!” it said.

Sara looked rather shy for a moment.

She gave a nod in return.

“Thank you,” she said, “for coming to my party.”

“Very pretty, indeed, Sara,” said Miss Minchin.

“Now I will leave you to enjoy yourselves.”

The instant she had left the room, the spell her presence always had upon them was broken.

The door had hardly closed before every seat was empty.

All the girls rushed toward the boxes.

Sara bent over the biggest box with a delighted face.

When she took out the Last Doll, it was so beautiful that the children made delighted sounds of joy.

“She is almost as big as Lottie,” someone said with surprise.

Lottie clapped her hands and danced about, laughing.

“Here is her trunk( 行李箱 ),” said Sara.

“Let us open it and look at her things.”

She sat down upon the floor and turned the key.

There were lace collars and silk stockings.

There was a jewel( 珠宝 ) case with a necklace which looked quite as if it was made of real diamonds.

Even Lavinia and Jessie forgot that they were too elderly to care for dolls, and expressed their delight.

“Suppose,” Sara said, as she stood by the table—“suppose she understands human talk and feels proud of being admired.”

“You are always supposing things,” said Lavinia unkindly.

“I know I am,” answered Sara.

“I like it. There is nothing so nice as supposing. If you suppose anything hard enough, it seems as if it were real.”

“It’s all very well to suppose things if you have everything,” said Lavinia.

“Could you suppose and pretend if you were a beggar?”

Sara looked thoughtful.

“I believe I could,” she said.

“If one was a beggar, one would have to suppose and pretend all the time. But it mightn’t be easy.”

She often thought later how strange it was that just as she had finished saying this—just at that very moment—Miss Amelia came into the room.
<hr>
“Sara,” she said, “your papa’s lawyer, Mr. Barrow, has called to see Miss Minchin.

She must talk to him alone and your food is laid in her parlor( 客厅 ).

So you had all better come and have your meal now, so that my sister can have her interview here in the classroom.”

Miss Amelia directed the orderly procession, and told Becky to go back to her work.

Sara led them all away, leaving the Last Doll sitting upon a chair with her wardrobe all about her.

Miss Minchin came into the room, with a little gentleman, who looked rather troubled.

Miss Minchin herself also looked rather troubled.

She sat down, and waved him to a chair.

“Please be seated, Mr. Barrow,” she said.

Mr. Barrow did not sit down at once.

His attention seemed attracted by the Last Doll and the things around her.

He put on his eyeglasses and looked at them in dislike.

“A hundred pounds,” Mr. Barrow remarked.

“He spent too much money, that young man.”

“I beg your pardon, Mr. Barrow,” she said with confusion( 困惑 ).

“I do not understand.”

“Birthday presents,” said Mr. Barrow, “to a child of eleven years old! Mad waste, I call it.”

Miss Minchin drew herself up still more firmly.

“Captain Crewe is a man of fortune,” she said.

“The diamond mines alone—”

“Diamond mines!” he broke out.

“There are none! Never were!”

Miss Minchin actually got up from her chair.

“What!” she cried. “What do you mean?”

“When a man is not a businessman himself, he had better keep away from his dear friend’s so-called diamond mines. The late Captain Crewe—”

Here Miss Minchin stopped him suddenly.

“The late Captain Crewe!” she cried out.

“The late! You don’t come to tell me that Captain Crewe is—”

“He’s dead, ma’am,” Mr. Barrow answered.

“Died of jungle fever( 丛林热 ) and business troubles together.”

Miss Minchin dropped into her chair again.

The words he had spoken filled her with fear.

“That young man had too much money.

The friend was mad about the diamond mine.

He put all his own money into it, and all Captain Crewe’s.

Then the friend ran away—Captain Crewe was already sick with fever when the news came.

The shock was too much for him.

He died speaking wildly about his little girl—and didn’t leave a penny.”

Never had Miss Minchin received such a blow in her life.

She felt as if she had been robbed, and that Captain Crewe and Sara and Mr. Barrow were equally to blame.

“Do you mean to tell me,” she cried out, “that he left nothing!

That Sara will have no fortune!

That she is left on my hands a little beggar instead of an heiress?”

“She is certainly left a beggar,” he replied.

“And she is certainly left on your hands, ma’am—as she hasn’t a relation in the world that we know of.”

“It is unjust!” she said.

“She’s in my sitting room at this moment, giving a party at my expense.

I was always so sure of his payments that I went to all sorts of ridiculous expenses for the child.

I paid the bills for that ridiculous doll and her ridiculous wardrobe.

The child was to have anything she wanted.

She has a carriage and a pony and a maid, and I’ve paid for all of them since the last cheque came.”

Mr. Barrow was not interested in listening to Miss Minchin’s complaints( 抱怨 ) after he had made his position clear.

Nor did he feel particularly sorry for angry keepers of boarding schools.

“You had better not pay for anything more, ma’am,” he remarked, “unless you want to make presents to the young lady.

She hasn’t any money to call her own.”

“But what am I to do?” demanded Miss Minchin.

“There isn’t anything to do,” said Mr. Barrow.

“Captain Crewe is dead. The child is left without money. Nobody is responsible for( 负有责任的 ) her but you.”

“I am not responsible for her, and I refuse to be made responsible!”

Miss Minchin became quite white with anger.

Mr. Barrow turned to go.

“I have nothing to do with that, madam,” he said without feeling.

“Barrow & Skipworth are not responsible. Very sorry the thing has happened, of course.”

“If you think I will take care of her, you are greatly mistaken,” Miss Minchin said forcefully.

“I have been robbed and cheated; I will turn her into the street!”

Mr. Barrow moved toward the door.

“I wouldn’t do that, madam,” he commented, “it wouldn’t look well. Unpleasant story for the school. Pupil sent out penniless and without friends.”

He was a clever businessman, and he knew what he was saying.

He also knew that Miss Minchin would be smart enough to see the truth.

She could not afford to do a thing which would make people speak of her as cruel and hard-hearted( 铁石心肠的 ).

“Better keep her and make use of her,” he added.

He bowed himself out and closed the door.

What he had said was quite true.

She knew it. She had absolutely( 绝对地 ) no choice.

Her show pupil had disappeared into nothingness, leaving only a lonely, little girl.

All the money she had spent on Sara was lost and could not be returned.
<hr>
And as she stood there breathless, there fell upon her ears a burst of voices from the party in her own room.

She could at least stop this.

But as she started toward the door, it was opened by Miss Amelia.

When she caught sight of her sister’s angry face, she fell back a step in alarm.

“What is the matter, sister?” she cried.

Miss Minchin’s voice was fierce when she answered:

“Where is Sara Crewe?”

Miss Amelia was confused.

“Sara!” she said with surprise.

“Why, she’s with the children in your room, of course.”

“Does she have a black dress in her grand wardrobe?”

“No—ye-es!” Miss Amelia said with uncertainty.

“But it is too short for her.

She has only the old black velvet, and it is too small for her.”

“Go and tell her to put the black one on, whether it is too short or not.

She has done with nice things!”

Then Miss Amelia began to cry.

“Oh, sister!” she said. “What has happened?”

Miss Minchin wasted no words.

“Captain Crewe is dead,” she said.

“He has died without a penny.

That spoiled child is left a beggar on my hands.”

“Hundreds of pounds have I spent on these silly presents for her.

And I shall never see a penny of it.

Put a stop to this ridiculous party of hers.

Go and make her change her dress at once.”

“I?” asked Miss Amelia.

“M-must I go and tell her now?”

“This moment!” was the fierce answer.

“Go!”

Poor Miss Amelia did not want to go into a room full of delighted children, and tell Sara that she had suddenly become a beggar.

But the thing must be done.

After sending Sara to her room to change her dress, Amelia returned to her sister for further instructions.

“Tell Sara to come to my room,” Miss Minchin said.

“And explain to her that I do not want any crying.”

“Sister,” replied Miss Amelia, “she is the strangest child I ever saw.

When I told her what had happened, she just stood quite still and looked at me without making a sound.

She went quite pale.

When I had finished, she still stood staring.

Then her chin( 下巴 ) began to shake, and she turned around and ran out of the room and upstairs.

It made me feel quite strange not to be answered; you expect people will say something—whatever it is.”

Sara had indeed run upstairs and locked her door.

She walked up and down, saying over and over again to herself in a voice which did not seem her own, “My papa is dead! My papa is dead!”

Sara already felt as if the birthday party had been a dream or a thing which had happened in the life of another little girl.

When she came into Miss Minchin’s sitting room, her face was white and her eyes had dark rings around them.

She had put on, without Mariette’s help, the black velvet dress.

It was too short and tight, and her legs looked long and thin.

She held Emily tightly in one arm.

“Put down your doll,” said Miss Minchin.

“What do you mean by bringing her here?”

“No,” Sara answered.

“I will not put her down. My papa gave her to me.”

She had always made Miss Minchin feel secretly uncomfortable, and she did so now.

“You will have no time for dolls in future,” she said.

“You will have to work and improve yourself and make yourself useful.”

Sara kept her big, strange eyes fixed on her, and did not speak.

“Everything will be very different now,” Miss Minchin said.

“I suppose Miss Amelia has explained matters to you.”

“Yes,” answered Sara.

“My papa is dead. He left me no money. I am quite poor.”

“You are a beggar,” said Miss Minchin, with her anger rising at the recollection( 回忆 ) of what all this meant.

“It appears that you have no one to take care of you.”

For a moment the thin, pale little face moved.

Sara again said nothing.

“What are you staring at?” demanded Miss Minchin.

“Do you understand?

I tell you that you are quite alone in the world.

You have no one to do anything for you, unless I choose to keep you here out of charity( 出于仁慈 ).”

“I understand,” answered Sara, in a low voice.

“That doll,” cried Miss Minchin, pointing to the beautiful birthday gift—“that ridiculous doll, with all her fancy things—I actually paid the bill for her!”

Sara turned her head toward the chair.

“The Last Doll,” she said.

And her little sad voice had a strange sound.

“The Last Doll, indeed!” said Miss Minchin.

“And she is mine, not yours. Everything you own is mine.”

“Please take it away from me, then,” said Sara.

“I do not want it.”

If she had cried and seemed frightened, Miss Minchin might almost have had more patience with her.

She was a woman who liked to feel her power.

As she looked at Sara’s pale little firm face, she felt as if Sara was much stronger than she was.

“You are not a princess any longer.

Your carriage and your pony will be sent away—your maid will be asked to leave.

You will wear your plainest clothes—your expensive ones no longer fit your station.

You are like Becky—you must work for your living.”
<hr>
To her surprise, a small light came into the child’s eyes.

“Can I work?” she said.

“If I can work it will not matter so much. What can I do?”

“You can do anything you are told,” was the answer.

“If you make yourself useful I may let you stay here.

You speak French well, and you can help with the younger children.”

“May I?” asked Sara.

“Oh, please let me! I know I can teach them.”

“You will have to do more than teach the little ones,” replied Miss Minchin.

“You will run errands( 跑腿 ) and help in the kitchen as well as in the classroom.

If you don’t please me, you will be sent away.

Remember that.

Now go.”

Sara stood still just a moment, looking at her.

Then she turned to leave the room.

“Stop!” said Miss Minchin.

“Don’t you wish to thank me?”

Sara paused, and all the deep, strange thoughts came to her mind.

“What for?” she said.

“For my kindness to you,” replied Miss Minchin.

“For my kindness in giving you a home.”

Sara made two or three steps toward her, and she spoke in an un-childishly fierce way.

“You are not kind,” she said.

“You are not kind, and it is not a home.”

And she had turned and run out of the room before Miss Minchin could do anything but stare after her with stony( 冷酷的 ) anger.

She went up the stairs slowly, holding Emily tightly against her side.

She meant to go to her room.

Just before she reached the landing, however, Miss Amelia came out of the door and closed it behind her.

She stood before it, looking nervous and awkward.

The truth was that she felt secretly ashamed of the thing she had been ordered to do.

“You—you are not to go in there,” she said.

“Not go in?” asked Sara with surprise.

“That is not your room now,” Miss Amelia answered, reddening a little.

Sara realized that this was the change Miss Minchin had spoken of.

“Where is my room?” she asked, hoping that her voice did not shake.

“You are to sleep in the attic next to Becky.”

Sara knew where it was.

Becky had told her about it.

She turned, and went up two flights( 阶梯 ) of stairs.

She felt as if she were leaving far behind her the world in which she had lived.

When she reached the attic door and opened it, her heart gave a sad little beat.

Then she shut the door and looked about her.

Yes, this was another world.

The room had a low white roof.

There was an unused fireplace, and a hard iron bed covered with an old blanket( 毯子 ).

Under the window in the roof, which showed nothing but a small piece of dull( 阴沉的 ) gray sky, there stood an old broken red footstool( 脚凳 ).

Sara went to it and sat down.

She seldom cried.

She did not cry now.

She laid Emily across her knees and put her face down upon her and her arms around her, and sat there.

As she sat in this silence there came a low knock at the door.

It was shyly pushed open and Becky’s tearful( 泪流满面的 ) face appeared round it.

“Oh, miss,” she said.

“Might I—would you allow me—to come in?”

Sara looked at her.

She tried to smile, and somehow she could not.

“Oh, Becky,” she said.

“I told you we were just the same—just two little girls.

You see how true it is.

There’s no difference now.

I’m not a princess anymore.”

Becky ran to her and caught her hand, sitting beside her and crying with love and pain.

“Yes, miss, you are,” she cried.

“Whatever happens to you, you are a princess all the same—and nothing could make you anything different.”

The first night she spent in her attic was a thing Sara never forgot.

“My papa is dead!” she kept whispering to herself.

“My papa is dead!”

Her bed was so hard that she turned over and over in it to find a place to rest.

The darkness was greater than any she had ever known.

The wind made a terrible sound over the roof among the chimneys.

Then there was something worse.

This was certain sounds coming from the walls.

She knew what they meant, because Becky had described them.

They meant rats and mice.

Once or twice she even heard the sound of feet moving across the floor.

When she heard them, she started up in bed and sat shaking.

When she lay down again, she covered her head with the blanket.

The change in her life did not come about slowly, but was made all at once.

“She must be taught what she is to expect at once,” Miss Minchin said to Miss Amelia.

Mariette had left the house the next morning.

The sight Sara caught of her sitting room, as she passed its open door, showed her that everything had been changed.

Her expensive things had been removed, and it was a new pupil’s bedroom now.

When she went down to breakfast she saw that her seat at Miss Minchin’s side was taken by Lavinia.

Miss Minchin spoke to her coldly.

“You will begin your new duties, Sara,” she said,

“by taking your seat with the younger children.

You must keep them quiet, and see that they behave well.”
<hr>
That was the beginning, and from day to day the duties given to her were added to.

She taught the younger children French but this was the least of her labors.

She was sent on errands( 差事 ) at any time and in all weathers.

The cook and the housemaids took their tone( 语气 ) from Miss Minchin.

They rather enjoyed ordering about the “young one” who had been treated like she was so special for so long.

Her own lessons became things of the past.

She was taught nothing.

Only after long and busy days was she allowed to go into the empty classroom, with a pile of old books, to study alone at night.

One of the most curious things in her new existence was her changed position among the pupils.

Instead of being a sort of royal presence among them, she no longer seemed to be one of their numbers at all.

She was kept so constantly at work that she hardly ever had an opportunity of speaking to any of them.

Miss Minchin preferred that she should live a life apart from the other girls.

The fact was that Miss Minchin’s pupils were used to being rich and comfortable.

Meanwhile, Sara’s dress grew shorter and more worn out.

Then the other girls found out that she was sent out to buy groceries( 杂货 ) and carry them through the streets.

They felt therefore, that when they spoke to her, they should treat her like a servant.

Sara worked like a slave.

She walked through the wet streets, carrying parcels( 包裹 ) and baskets.

Her heart grew proud and angry, but she never told anyone what she felt.

“Soldiers don’t complain( 抱怨 ),” she would say to herself, “I am not going to do it; I will pretend this is part of a war.”

But there were hours when her child heart might almost have broken with loneliness but for two people.

The first was Becky.

They had little chance to speak to each other during the day.

But before sunrise she used to come into Sara’s attic and help her dress.

And when night came, Sara always heard the knock at her door which meant that Becky was ready to help her again if she was needed.

The second comforter( 安慰者 ) was Ermengarde, but strange things happened before Ermengarde found her place.

When Sara’s mind seemed to awaken again to the life about her, she realized that she had forgotten about Ermengarde.

That was because she had been suddenly called home for a few weeks.

When she came back she did not see Sara for a day or two.

When Ermengarde met Sara for the first time, she saw her coming down a hallway( 走廊 ) with her arms full of clothing which were to be taken downstairs to be fixed.

Ermengarde could not think of anything to say.

She knew what had happened, but, somehow, she had never imagined Sara could look like this—so poor and almost like a servant.

It made her quite upset, and she could do nothing but break into a short laugh and say—“Oh, Sara, is that you?”

“Yes,” answered Sara.

“Oh,” she said nervously.

“How—how are you?”

“I don’t know,” Sara replied.

“How are you?”

“I’m—I’m quite well,” said Ermengarde, shyly.

Then she thought of something to say which seemed more considerate( 体贴的 ).

“Are you—are you very unhappy?” she said in a rush.

Then Sara was guilty( 内疚的 ) of an injustice.

Just at that moment her torn( 破碎的 ) heart grew within her.

She felt that if anyone was as stupid as that, one had better get away from her.

“What do you think?” she said.

“Do you think I am very happy?”

And she marched past Ermengarde without another word.

For several weeks, when they met by chance Sara looked the other way, and Ermengarde felt too ashamed to speak.

Sometimes they nodded to each other in passing, but there were times when they did not even exchange a greeting.

One night, when Sara went to her attic, she was surprised to see a light coming from under the attic door.

“Nobody goes there but myself,” she thought quickly, “but someone has lighted a candle.”

Someone had, indeed, lighted a candle, and was sitting upon the footstool, dressed in her nightgown( 睡衣 ).

It was Ermengarde.

“Ermengarde!” cried Sara.

“You will get into trouble.”

Ermengarde stood up.

Her eyes and nose were pink with crying.

“I know I shall—if I’m found out,” she said.

“But I don’t care—I don’t care a bit.

Oh, Sara, please tell me.

What is the matter?

Why don’t you like me anymore?”

Something in her voice made Sara suddenly remember her affection( 喜爱 ) for her old friend.

It was so loving and simple—so like the old Ermengarde who had asked her to be “best friends.”

“I do like you,” Sara answered.

“I thought—you see, everything is different now.

I thought you—were different.”

Ermengarde opened her wet eyes wide.

“Why, it was you who were different!” she cried.

“You didn’t want to talk to me.

I didn’t know what to do.

It was you who were different after I came back.”

Sara thought a moment.

She saw she had made a mistake.

“I am different,” she explained, “though not in the way you think.

Miss Minchin does not want me to talk to the girls.

Most of them don’t want to talk to me.

I thought—perhaps—you didn’t.”

“Oh, Sara,” Ermengarde cried out.

And they rushed into each other’s arms.

Then they sat down upon the floor together.

Ermengarde looked round the attic with curiosity.

“Sara,” she said, “do you think you can bear living here?”

“If I pretend it’s quite different, I can,” she answered, “or if I pretend it is a place in a story.”
<hr>
She spoke slowly.

Her imagination was beginning to work for her.

It had not worked for her at all since her troubles had come upon her.

She had felt as if it had been blocked.

“Other people have lived in worse places.

Think of the people in the Bastille!”

“The Bastille,” half whispered Ermengarde, watching her and beginning to be interested.

She remembered stories of the French Revolution which Sara had told her.

“Yes,” she said, hugging her knees, “that will be a good place to pretend about.

I am a prisoner in the Bastille.

I have been here for years and years, and everybody has forgotten about me.

Miss Minchin is the jailer( 狱卒 )—and Becky is the prisoner in the next cell( 牢房 ).”

She turned to Ermengarde, looking quite like the old Sara.

“I shall pretend that,” she said, “and it will be a great comfort.”

Ermengarde was filled with wonder.

“And will you tell me all about it?” she said.

“May I secretly come up here at night, and hear the things you have made up in the day?

It will seem as if we were more ‘best friends’ than ever.”

“Yes,” answered Sara, nodding.

“Hard times try people, and mine have tried you and shown how nice you are.”

Lottie was much confused by the change she saw in her young adopted mother.

She had heard that strange things had happened to Sara.

She could not understand, however, why Sara looked different.

Why did she wear an old black dress and only come into the classroom to teach?

“Are you very poor now, Sara, like a beggar?” she had asked secretly the first morning her friend took charge of the French class.

She looked at Sara with sad eyes.

“I don’t want you to be poor as a beggar.”

She looked as if she was going to cry.

And Sara hurriedly comforted her.

“Beggars have nowhere to live,” she said courageously.

“I have a place to live.”

“Where do you live?” Lottie asked.

“The new girl sleeps in your room.”

“I live in another room,” said Sara.

“Is it a nice one?” Lottie kept asking.

“I want to go and see it.”

“You must not talk,” said Sara.

“Miss Minchin is looking at us.

She will be angry with me for letting you whisper.”

She knew that she was to be held accountable for everything which was objected to.

If the children were not paying attention, if they talked, if they were restless, it was she who would be blamed.

When Sara came back to her attic that day, she stood in the middle of it and looked about her.

The bed was hard and covered with its old blanket.

The white wall showed its broken areas, the floor was cold and empty, and the broken footstool was the only seat in the room.

She sat down on it for a few minutes and let her head drop in her hands.

“It’s a lonely place,” she said. “Sometimes it’s the loneliest place in the world.”

She was sitting in this way when her attention was attracted by a slight sound near her. She lifted her head to see where it came from.

If she had been a nervous child, she would have left her seat on the footstool in a hurry.

A large rat was sitting up on his back legs and sniffing( 嗅 ) the air.

Some crumbs had dropped upon the floor and their smell had drawn him out of his hole.

Sara was rather interested in this gray little animal.

He looked at her with his bright eyes, as if he were asking a question.

“It must be rather hard to be a rat,” she thought.

“Nobody likes you. People jump and run away and scream out, ‘oh, an awful rat!’

I wouldn’t like it if people screamed and jumped and said, ‘Oh, an awful Sara!’ the moment they saw me.”

She had sat so quietly that the rat had begun to take courage.

He was very hungry.

He had a wife and a large family in the wall, and they had had bad luck for several days.

He had left the children crying, and felt he would risk a good deal for a few crumbs, so he carefully dropped upon his feet.

“Come on,” said Sara; “I’m not a trap.

You can have them, poor thing!

Prisoners in the Bastille used to make friends with rats.

Suppose I make friends with you.”

He was really a very nice rat, and did not mean the least harm.

He went softly toward the crumbs and began to eat them.

As he did it he looked every now and then at Sara, and his expression was so sorry that it touched her heart.

She sat and watched him without making any movement.

One crumb was very much larger than the others—in fact, it could hardly be called a crumb.

It was evident that he wanted that piece very much, but it lay quite near the footstool and he was still rather shy.

The rat came a little nearer and ate a few more crumbs.

Then he stopped and sniffed, giving a side look at Sara on the footstool.

He moved quickly at the piece, and the second he had taken it, ran back to the wall.

Then he slipped down into an opening, and was gone.

“I do believe I could make friends with him,” said Sara.

“I will call him Melchisedec.”
<hr>
A week or so later, Ermengarde had found it safe to steal up to the attic, and Sara told her about her new friend.

Ermengarde was interested, as she always was.

“When you talk about things,” she said, “they seem as if they grew real.

You talk about Melchisedec as if he was a person.”

“He is a person,” said Sara.

“He gets hungry and frightened, just as we do.

How do we know he doesn’t think things, just as we do?

His eyes look as if he was a person.

That was why I gave him a name.”

“Besides,” she said, “he is a Bastille rat sent to be my friend.

I can always get a bit of bread the cook has thrown away, and it is quite enough to support him.”

“Do you always pretend it is the Bastille?” asked Ermengarde.

“Nearly always,” answered Sara.

Just at that moment Ermengarde almost jumped off the bed, she was so surprised by a sound she heard.

It was like two knocks on the wall.

“What is that?” she asked nervously.

Sara got up from the floor and answered quite dramatically( 戏剧性地 ):

“It is the prisoner in the next cell.”

“Becky!” cried Ermengarde, excitedly.

“Yes,” said Sara.

“Listen; the two knocks meant, ‘Prisoner, are you there?’ ”

She knocked three times on the wall herself, as if in answer.

“That means, ‘Yes, I am here, and all is well.’ ”

Four knocks came from Becky’s side of the wall.

“That means,” explained Sara, “ ‘Then, fellow-sufferer( 难友 ), we will sleep in peace. Good night.’ ”

Ermengarde beamed( 绽开笑容 ) with delight.

“Oh, Sara!” she whispered joyfully.

“It is like a story!”

“It is a story,” said Sara.

“everything’s a story.”

And she sat down again and talked until Ermengarde forgot that she was a sort of escaped prisoner herself.

She had to be reminded by Sara that she could not remain in the Bastille all night.

She must steal quietly downstairs again and return to her bed.

But it was a dangerous thing for Ermengarde to make trips to the attic.

She could never be quite sure when Sara would be there.

She could also never be certain that Miss Amelia would not make a tour through the bedrooms after the pupils were supposed to be asleep.

So her visits were seldom, and Sara lived a lonely life.

In the evening, Sara passed houses whose windows were lighted up.

She used to look into the warm rooms and imagine things about the people she saw sitting before the fires or about the tables.

There were several families in the square in which Miss Minchin lived, with which she had become quite familiar in a way of her own.

The one she liked best she called the Large Family.

She called it the Large Family not because the members of it were big—for, indeed, most of them were little—but because there were so many of them.

There were eight children in the Large Family, and a kind, warm mother, and a kind, warm father, and many servants.

The eight children were always either being taken out to walk by nurses, or they were going to drive with their mamma.

They were flying to the door in the evening to meet their papa and kiss him and dance around him.

They were crowding about the nursery windows and looking out and pushing each other and laughing.

In fact, they were always doing something enjoyable and suited to a large family.

Sara was quite fond of them, and had given them names out of books—quite romantic names.

She called them the Montmorencys when she did not call them the Large Family.

She gave special names to the children, like Rosalind Gladys, Guy Clarence, and Veronica Eustacia.

One evening a very funny thing happened—though, perhaps, in one sense it was not a funny thing at all.

Several of the Montmorencys were evidently going to a children’s party.

Just as Sara was about to pass the door, they were crossing the pavement( 人行道 ) to get into the carriage which was waiting for them.

Veronica Eustacia and Rosalind Gladys, in white lace dresses, had just got in. Guy Clarence, who was five years old, was following them.

He was such a pretty fellow and had such pink cheeks and blue eyes that Sara paused and looked at him.

It was Christmas time.

The Large Family had been hearing many stories about children who were poor and cold and hungry.

In the stories, kind people—sometimes little boys and girls—saw the poor children and gave them money or rich gifts.

Guy Clarence burned with a desire to find such a poor child and give her a certain sixpence he had.

As he crossed the pavement to the carriage, he saw Sara standing in her worn out( 破旧不堪的 ) dress and hat, looking at him hungrily.

He thought that her eyes looked hungry because she had perhaps had nothing to eat for a long time.

He did not know that they looked so because she was hungry for the warm, happy life his home held.

He put his hand in his pocket and found his sixpence and walked up to her.
<hr>
“Here, poor little girl,” he said.

“Here is a sixpence. I will give it to you.”

Sara started, and all at once realized that she looked exactly like poor children she had seen in her better days.

“Oh, no!” she said.

“Oh, no, thank you! I mustn’t take it, indeed!”

Her voice was so unlike an ordinary street child’s voice.

Her manner was so like the manner of a well brought up little person that Veronica Eustacia (whose real name was Janet) and Rosalind Gladys (who was really called Nora) moved forward to listen.

But Guy Clarence (who was really called Donald) put the sixpence in her hand.

“Yes, you must take it, poor little girl!” he said firmly.

“You can buy things to eat with it. It is a whole sixpence!”

There was something so honest and kind in his face.

He looked likely to be sadly disappointed if she did not take it.

Sara knew she must not refuse him.

“Thank you,” she said.

“You are a kind, kind little darling thing.”

He climbed happily into the carriage.

She went away, trying to smile, though she caught her breath quickly.

Her eyes were shining through a mist.

She had known that she looked strange and poor, but until now she had not known that she might be taken for a beggar.

As the Large Family’s carriage drove away, the children inside it were talking with interested excitement.

Sara knew nothing about the fact, but from that time the Large Family was as interested in her as she was in it.

Faces used to appear at the nursery windows when she passed, and many discussions concerning her were held round the fire.

“She is a kind of servant at the school,” Janet said.

“I don’t believe she belongs to anybody.

I believe she is an orphan( 孤儿 ).

But she is not a beggar, however poor she looks.”

And later she was called by all of them, “The-little-girl-who-is-not-a-beggar.”

Sara managed to bore( 钻孔 ) a hole in the sixpence and hung it on an old bit of thin ribbon round her neck.

Though she was very fond of the Large Family, she remained quite lonely in her attic room.

She had wished very much that someone would take the empty house next door.

She wished it because of the attic window which was so near hers.

It would be so nice to see it open one day and a head and shoulders rising out of the square opening.

“If it looked a nice head,” she thought, “I might begin by saying, ‘Good morning,’ and all sorts of things might happen.”

One morning, on turning the corner of the square after a visit to the grocer’s, the butcher’s, and the baker’s, she saw something that made her very happy.

During her long absence, a van( 货车 ) full of furniture had stopped before the next house.

The front doors were thrown open, and men were going in and out carrying heavy packages and pieces of furniture.

“It’s taken!” she said.

“It really is taken! Oh, I do hope a nice head will look out of the attic window!”

Several pieces of furniture had been set out of the van upon the pavement.

There was a beautiful wooden table, and some chairs, and a screen covered with rich Oriental( 东方的 ) design.

The sight of them gave her a strange, homesick( 思乡的 ) feeling.

She had seen things so like them in India.

All the furniture was rich and beautiful, and a great deal of it was Oriental.

Wonderful carpets and curtains were taken from the vans, many pictures, and books enough for a library.

Among other things there was a statue of the god Buddha( 佛像 ).

“Someone in the family must have been in India,” Sara thought.

“They have got used to Indian things and like them.

I am glad.

I shall feel as if they were friends, even if a head never looks out of the attic window.”

When she was taking in the evening’s milk for the cook (there was really no job she was not called upon to do), she saw something which made the situation more interesting than ever.

The handsome man who was the father of the Large Family walked across the square, and ran up the steps of the next-door house.

He ran up them as if he felt quite at home and expected to run up and down them many a time in the future.

It was quite certain that he was in some close way connected with the newcomers.

At night, after her work was done, Becky came in to see her fellow prisoner and bring her news.

“It’s an Indian gentleman that’s coming to live next door, miss,” she said.

“He’s very rich, and he’s ill, and the gentleman of the Large Family is his lawyer.

He’s had a lot of trouble, and it’s made him ill and low in his mind.”
<hr>
It was several weeks before they found out that the new occupant( 住户 ) had neither wife nor children.

He was a single man with no family at all, and it was evident that he was unwell in body and unhappy in mind.

A carriage drove up one day and stopped before the house.

When the footman( 男仆 ) came down from the box and opened the door, the gentleman who was the father of the Large Family got out first.

After him there came a nurse and two men-servants.

They came to help their master out of the carriage.

He was a man with a tired, unhappy face, and a thin body covered in furs.

He was carried up the steps, and the head of the Large Family went with him, looking very anxious.

Soon a doctor’s carriage arrived, and the doctor went in—plainly to take care of him.

That was the beginning of the story of the Indian gentleman.

There were fine sunsets even in the square, sometimes.

One could only see parts of them, however, between the chimneys and over the roofs.

From the kitchen windows one could not see them at all, and could only guess that they were going on.

There was, however, one place from which one could see all the beauty of them: the attic window.

The square would suddenly seem to light up in a magical way and look wonderful despite its dirty trees and houses.

When she would see this, Sara knew something was going on in the sky.

When it was possible to leave the kitchen without being missed or called back, she would steal away and go up the flights of stairs.

She would climb on the old table, and get her head and body as far out of the window as possible.

When she had done this, she always drew a long breath and looked all round her.

It used to seem as if she had all the sky and the world to herself.

There was a beautiful sunset a few days after the Indian gentleman was brought to his new home.

She climbed on her table and stood looking out.

It was a wonderful moment.

There were floods of shining gold covering the western sky, as if a glorious tide( 潮汐 ) was sweeping over the world.

A deep, rich yellow light filled the air; the birds flying across the tops of the houses looked quite black as they flew in front of the shining light.

“It’s a beautiful one,” said Sara, softly, to herself.

“It makes me feel almost afraid—as if something strange was just going to happen.

The beautiful ones always make me feel like that.”

She suddenly turned her head because she heard a sound a few yards away from her.

It was a strange sound like a little high voice. It came from the window of the next attic.

Someone had come to look at the sunset as she had.

There was a head and a part of a body sticking out from the skylight( 天窗 ).

It was not the head or body of a little girl or a housemaid.

It was the dark-faced, bright-eyed, white-turbaned head of a native Indian man-servant.

“A Lascar,” Sara said to herself quickly—and the sound she had heard came from a small monkey which was curled up( 蜷缩 ) in his arms and making noises against his breast.

As Sara looked toward him he looked toward her.

The first thing she thought was that his dark face looked sad and homesick.

She felt sure that he had come up to look at the sun.

He had seen it so seldom in England that he must have longed for a sight of it.

She looked at him with interest for a second, and then smiled across the roof.

She had learned to know how comforting a smile, even from a stranger, may be.

Hers was evidently a pleasure to him.

His whole expression changed.

He showed such bright white teeth as he smiled back that it was as if a light had been turned on in his dark face.

It was perhaps in seeing her that he lost his hold on the monkey.

He was a restless monkey and always ready for adventure, and it is probable that the sight of a little girl excited him.

He suddenly jumped on to the roof, ran across it, and went onto Sara’s shoulder, and from there down into her attic room.

It made her laugh and delighted her, but she knew he must be given back to his master.

She wondered how this was to be done.

Would he let her catch him?

Or would he refuse to be caught, and perhaps get away and run off over the roofs and be lost?

That would not do at all.

She turned to the Lascar, feeling glad that she remembered still some of the Hindustani( 印度斯坦语 ) she had learned when she lived with her father.

She could make the man understand.

She spoke to him in the language he knew.

“Will he let me catch him?” she asked.

She thought she had never seen more surprise and happiness than the dark face expressed when she spoke in the language he knew.

“The monkey was a good monkey and would not bite,” the man replied, “but, unfortunately, he was difficult to catch.”

If Sara would allow Ram Dass, for that was the man’s name, to cross the roof to her room, and enter the windows, he could take the little animal back.

But he was evidently afraid Sara might think he was being disrespectful( 失礼的 ) and perhaps would not let him come.

But Sara gave him leave at once.

“Can you get across?” she asked.

“In a moment,” he answered her.

“Then come,” she said; “he is flying from side to side of the room as if he was frightened.”
<hr>
Ram Dass came up through his attic window and crossed to hers as steadily( 稳步地 ) and lightly as if he had walked on roofs all his life.

He went through the skylight and dropped upon his feet without a sound.

Then he turned to Sara and bowed to her.

The monkey saw him and gave a little scream.

Ram Dass quickly closed the skylight, and then went to catch him.

It did not take very long.

The monkey made it last a few minutes evidently for the mere fun of it.

Presently he sprang on to Ram Dass’s shoulder and sat there hanging onto his neck with a little skinny arm.

Ram Dass thanked Sara deeply.

She had seen that his quick eyes had taken in at a look all the emptiness( 空旷 ) of the room.

He spoke to her, however, as if he were speaking to the little daughter of a king, and pretended that he saw nothing.

He did not remain more than a few moments after he had caught the monkey.

His master, who was ill, was sometimes amused( 被逗笑 ) by the animal, Ram Dass explained.

He would have been made sad if his favorite had run away and been lost.

Then he bowed once more and got through the skylight and across the roof again.

When he had gone, Sara stood in the middle of her attic.

She thought of many things his face and his manner had brought back to her.

The sight of his clothing and the seriousness of his manner awoke all her past memories( 记忆 ).

It seemed strange that only a few years ago, she had servants who treated her as Ram Dass had treated her.

It was like a sort of dream.

It was all over, and it could never come back.

Then a thought came back to her, which made the color rise in her face and a light shine in her eyes.

She straightened her thin little body and lifted her head.

“Whatever comes,” she said, “cannot change one thing.

If I am a princess in rags and worn out clothes, I can be a princess inside.

It would be easy to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold. It is a great deal more of a victory to be one all the time when no one knows it.”

This was not a new thought, but quite an old one, by this time.

It had comforted her through many a difficult day.

The morning after the interview with Ram Dass and his monkey, Sara was in the classroom with her small pupils.

Having finished giving them their lessons, she was putting the French exercise books together.

She was also thinking of the various things royal people in disguise( 伪装 ) were called upon to do.

Alfred the Great( 阿尔弗雷德大帝 ), for instance, after burning some cakes, got his ears boxed by the wife of the shepherd( 牧人 ).

How frightened the wife must have been when she found out what she had done.

If Miss Minchin should find out that she—Sara, whose toes( 脚趾 ) were almost sticking out of her boots—was a princess—a real one!

The look in Sara’s eyes was exactly the look which Miss Minchin most disliked.

She would not have it.

Since Miss Minchin was angry and standing quite close to Sara, she actually flew at her and boxed her ears.

It was exactly like the shepherd’s wife who had boxed King Alfred’s.

It made Sara start.

She wakened from her dream at the surprise.

Catching her breath, she stood still a second.

Then, not knowing she was going to do it, she broke into a little laugh.

“What are you laughing at, you rude child?” Miss Minchin cried out.

It took Sara a few seconds to control herself enough to remember that she was a princess.

“I was thinking,” she answered.

“Beg my pardon immediately,” said Miss Minchin.

Sara stopped a second before she replied.

“I will beg your pardon for laughing, if it was rude,” she said then, “but I won’t beg your pardon for thinking.”

“What were you thinking?” demanded Miss Minchin.

“How dare you think? What were you thinking?”

Jessie and Lavinia laughed quietly together.

All the girls looked up from their books to listen.

“I was thinking,” she answered politely, “that you did not know what you were doing.”

“That I did not know what I was doing?” Miss Minchin asked with surprise.

“Yes,” said Sara. “I was thinking what would happen if I were a princess and you boxed my ears—what I should do to you.

I was thinking how surprised and frightened you would be if you suddenly found out—”

“What?” she asked. “Found out what?”

“That I really was a princess,” said Sara, “and could do anything—anything I liked.”

Every pair of eyes in the room widened to its full limit.

“Go to your room,” cried Miss Minchin, breathlessly, “this instant! Leave the classroom! Attend( 专心 ) to your lessons, young ladies!”

Sara made a little bow.

“Excuse me for laughing if it was improper,” she said, and walked out of the room.

Miss Minchin was left struggling with her anger, and the girls whispered over their books.

“Did you see her? Did you see how strange she looked?” Jessie broke out.

“I shouldn’t be at all surprised if she did turn out to be something.

Suppose she should!”
<hr>
The school was in a row of connected houses, and Sara liked to think of the things being done on the other side of the wall of the rooms she lived in.

She amused herself by imagining the things hidden by the wall which divided the school from the Indian gentleman’s house.

She knew that the classroom was next to the Indian gentleman’s study.

She hoped that the wall was thick so that the noise made sometimes after lesson hours would not trouble him.

“I am growing quite fond of him,” she said to Ermengarde;

“I should not like him to be troubled.

I have adopted him for a friend.

You can do that with people you never speak to at all.

You can just watch them, and think about them and be sorry for them, until they seem almost like relations.

I’m quite anxious sometimes when I see the doctor come to visit twice a day.”

There was much discussion of his case in the kitchen, where the servants knew everything through some mysterious means.

He was not an Indian gentleman really, but an Englishman who had lived in India.

He had met with great misfortunes which had for a time so endangered( 危及 ) his whole fortune that he had thought himself ruined forever.

The shock had been so great that he had almost died of brain fever.

Since then, he had been sick, though his fortunes had changed and all his possessions had been given back to him.

His trouble had been connected with mines.

“And mines with diamonds in them!” said the cook.

“No savings of mine will ever go into mines—particular diamond ones”—with a side look at Sara.

“We all know something of them.”

“He felt as my papa felt,” Sara thought.

“He was ill as my papa was, but he did not die.”

So her heart was more drawn to him than before.

When she was sent out at night, she used sometimes to feel quite glad.

There was always a chance that the curtains of the house next door might not yet be closed.

Then she could look into the warm room and see her adopted friend.

The gentleman she called Mr. Montmorency went to see him often, and Mrs. Montmorency and all the little Montmorencys went, too, though less often.

He had, in fact, a very caring place in his heart for all children, and particularly for little girls. Janet and Nora were as fond of him as he was of them.

“He is a poor thing,” said Janet, “and he says we cheer him up. We try to cheer him up very quietly.”

The Indian gentleman’s real name was Mr. Carrisford, and Janet told Mr. Carrisford about their meeting with the little-girl-who-was-not-a-beggar.

He was very much interested, and all the more so when he heard from Ram Dass of the adventure of the monkey on the roof.

Ram Dass made for him a very clear picture of the attic and its loneliness.

He mentioned the empty floor and broken wall, the unused, empty fireplace, and the hard, small bed.

“Carmichael,” he said to the father of the Large Family, after he had heard Ram Dass’s description.

“I wonder how many of the attics in this square are like that one.

How many poor little servant girls sleep on such beds, while I cannot sleep on my down pillows, troubled by wealth that is, most of it—not mine.”

“My dear fellow,” Mr. Carmichael answered cheerily, “the sooner you stop worrying, the better it will be for you.

Even if you had all the wealth of all the Indies, you still could not set right all the discomforts in the world.

If you began to make all the attics in this square more livable, there would still remain all the attics in all the other squares and streets to put in order. And there you are!”

Mr. Carrisford sat and bit his nails as he looked into the shining bed of coals in the fireplace.

“Do you suppose,” he said slowly, after a pause—

“do you think it is possible that the other child—the child I never stop thinking of—could be—could possibly be lowered to any such condition as the poor little girl next door?”

Mr. Carmichael looked at him uneasily.

He knew that the worst thing the man could do for himself, for his reason and his health, was to begin to think of this particular subject.

“If the child at Madame Pascal’s school in Paris was the one you are searching for,” he answered kindly, “she is with people who can afford to take care of her.

They adopted( 收养 ) her because she had been the favorite companion of their little daughter who died.

They had no other children, and Madame Pascal said that they were very well-to-do Russians.”

“And the terrible woman actually did not know where they had taken her!” said Mr. Carrisford angrily.

Mr. Carmichael shrugged( 耸肩 ) his shoulders.

“The adopted parents seem to have disappeared and left no trace( 踪迹 ).”

“But you say ‘if’ the child was the one I am searching for.

You say ‘if.’ We are not sure. There was a difference in the name.”

“Madame Pascal pronounced it as if it were Carew instead of Crewe—but that might be merely a matter of accent.

The situations were strangely similar.

An English officer in India had placed his motherless little girl at the school.

He had died suddenly after losing his money.”
<hr>
Mr. Carmichael paused a moment, as if a new thought had occurred to him.

“Are you sure the child was left at a school in Paris?

Are you sure it was Paris?”

“My dear fellow,” said Carrisford, with restless impatience( 急躁 ), “I am sure of nothing.

I never saw either the child or her mother.

Ralph Crewe and I loved each other as boys, but we had not met since our school days, until we met in India.

I was taken in by the grand promise of the mines.

He was, too.

The whole thing was so huge that we half lost our heads.

When we met we hardly spoke of anything else.

I only knew that the child had been sent to school somewhere.

I do not even remember, now, how I knew it.”

The Indian gentleman moved forward and struck the table with a long, wasted hand.

“Carmichael,” he said, “I must find her.

If she is alive, she is somewhere.

If she is alone and penniless, it is through my fault.

How is a man to get back his health with a thing like that on his mind?

This sudden change of luck at the mines has made realities of all our most fantastic dreams.

But poor Crewe’s child may be begging in the street!”

“Come, come,” said Carmichael.

“We shall find her soon.

We will continue to search for Madame Pascal’s good Russians.

She seemed to think that they lived in Moscow.”

On the other side of the wall, Sara was sitting in her attic talking to Melchisedec, who had come out for his evening meal.

“It has been hard to be a princess today, Melchisedec,” she said.

“It has been harder than usual. It gets harder as the weather grows colder and the streets get more wet.

Lavinia laughed at my muddy( 污浊的 ) skirt as I passed her in the hall today.

I thought of something to say all in a flash—and I only just stopped myself in time.

You can’t talk back at people like that—if you are a princess.

But you have to bite your tongue to hold yourself in.

I bit mine. It was a cold afternoon, Melchisedec. And it’s a cold night.”

Quite suddenly she put her black head down in her arms, as she often did when she was alone.

“Oh, papa,” she whispered, “what a long time it seems since I was your ‘Little Missus’!”

This was what happened that day on both sides of the wall.

The winter was an awful one.

There were days on which Sara walked through snow when she went on her errands.

There were worse days when the snow melted( 融化 ) and joined with mud( 泥 ) to form slush( 雪泥 ).

On such days the windows of the house of the Large Family always looked very pleasant.

The study in which the Indian gentleman sat was lit up with warmth.

But the attic was dark and cheerless beyond words.

She had many opportunities of proving to herself whether or not she was a princess.

One of the strongest tests she was ever given came on a certain cold day.

She would often think of it later, even in the years to come.

For several days it had rained continuously; the streets were full of cold mist.

Of course there were several long and tiring( 累人的 ) errands to be done.

There always were hard tasks to be done on days like these. Sara was sent out again and again, until her old clothes were wet through.

Added to this, she was not given any dinner, because Miss Minchin had chosen to punish her.

She was so cold and hungry and tired that her face began to have a tense look.

But she hurried on, trying to make her mind think of something else.

Her way of doing it was to “pretend” and “suppose” with all the strength that was left in her.

“Suppose I had dry clothes on,” she thought, “suppose I had good shoes and a long, thick coat and a whole umbrella.

And suppose—suppose—just when I was near a baker’s where they sold hot buns( 小圆面包 ), I should find sixpence—which belonged to nobody.

Suppose if I did, I should go into the shop and buy six of the hottest buns and eat them all without stopping.”

Some very strange things happen in this world sometimes.

It certainly was a strange thing that happened to Sara.

She had to cross the street just when she was saying this to herself.

The mud was deep—she almost had got stuck.

She picked her way as carefully as she could, but she could not save herself much.

In picking her way, she had to look down at her feet and the mud.

In looking down—just as she reached the pavement—she saw something shining on the ground.

It was actually a piece of silver—a tiny piece stepped on by many feet, but still with spirit enough left to shine a little.

Not quite a sixpence, but the next thing to it—a fourpenny( 四便士 ) piece.
<hr>
In one second it was in her cold little hand.

“Oh,” she cried, “it is true! It is true!”

And then, if you will believe me, she looked straight at the shop directly facing her.

And it was a baker’s shop.

A cheerful motherly woman with pink cheeks was putting into the window a tray( 托盘 ) of delicious newly baked hot buns—large, shiny buns, with currants( 黑加仑 ) in them.

It almost made Sara feel weak for a few seconds—the surprise, and the sight of the buns, and the delightful smells of warm bread coming from the baker’s window.

She knew she should not wait to use the little piece of money.

So she crossed the pavement and put her wet foot on the step.

As she did so she saw something that made her stop.

It was a little figure more unhappy even than herself.

She was not much more than a pile of rags, from which small muddy feet stuck out.

Above the rags appeared a head of messy hair, and a dirty face with big hungry eyes.

Sara knew they were hungry eyes the moment she saw them, and she felt a sudden need to help her.

“This,” she said to herself, with a little sigh, “is one of the common people—and she is hungrier than I am.”

The child—this “one of the common people”—looked up at Sara, and moved herself to the side a little, so as to give her room to pass.

Sara held onto her little fourpenny piece and stopped for a few seconds.

Then she spoke to her.

“Are you hungry?” she asked.

“Yes, very,” the child said in a rough voice.

“Haven’t you had any dinner?” said Sara.

“No dinner, nor yet no breakfast—nor yet no supper. No nothing.”

“Since when?” asked Sara.

“Don’t know. Never got nothing today—nowhere. I’ve asked and asked.”

Just to look at her made Sara more hungry and weak.

But those little thoughts were at work in her brain.

“If I’m a princess,” she thought, “should I do what princesses do?

When they were poor and driven from their thrones( 王位 ), they always share with the common people, especially if they meet one poorer and hungrier than themselves.

They always shared.

Buns are a penny each.

If it had been sixpence I could have eaten six.

It won’t be enough for either of us.

But it will be better than nothing.”

“Wait a minute,” she said to the beggar child.

She went into the shop.

It was warm and smelled delicious.

The woman was just going to put some more hot buns into the window.

“Do you want to buy something?” the woman asked, as she saw Sara look at the buns.

“Four buns, if you please,” said Sara.

“Those at a penny each.”

The woman went to the window and put some in a paper bag.

Sara noticed that she put in six.

“I said four, if you please,” she explained.

“I have only fourpence.”

“I’ll throw in two more,” said the woman with her kind look.

“I’m sure you can eat them sometime. Aren’t you hungry?”

A mist rose before Sara’s eyes.

“Yes,” she answered.

“I am very hungry, and I am very thankful to you for your kindness.

When Sara left the bakery, the beggar girl was still curled up in the corner of the step.

She looked frightful in her wet and dirty rags.

Sara opened the paper bag and took out one of the hot buns, which had already warmed her own cold hands a little.

“See,” she said, giving the bun to the child, “this is nice and hot. Eat it, and you will not feel so hungry.”

The child started and looked up at her, as if such sudden, wonderful good luck almost frightened her.

Then she quickly picked up the bun and began to stuff( 把...塞进...里 ) it into her mouth with great animal-like bites.

“Oh, my! Oh, my!” Sara heard her say roughly, with wild happiness. “Oh, my!”

Sara took out three more buns and put them down.

The sound in the rough, hungry voice was awful.

“She is hungrier than I am,” she said to herself.

“She’s starving( 饿极了的 ).”

But her hand shook when she put down the fourth bun.

“I’m not starving,” she said—and she put down the fifth.

The little girl was still eating when she turned away.

Even if she had ever been taught to be polite, she was too hungry to give any thanks.

But actually, she had never been taught at all.

“Good-bye,” said Sara, and she walked away.

At that moment the baker woman looked out of her shop window.

“Well, I have never seen anything like this!” she cried.

“That young one gave her buns to a beggar child!

It wasn’t because she didn’t want them, either.

Well, well, she looked hungry enough.

I’d give something to know what she did it for.”
<hr>
She went to the door and spoke to the beggar child.

“Who gave you those buns?” she asked her.

The child nodded her head toward Sara’s disappearing figure.

“What did she say?” asked the woman.

“Asked me if I was hungry,” replied the hoarse( 嘶哑的 ) voice.

“What did you say?”

“Said I was.”

“And then she came in and got the buns, and gave them to you, did she?”

The child nodded.

“How many?”

“Five.”

The woman thought it over.

“Left just one for herself,” she said in a low voice, “and she could have eaten the whole six—I saw it in her eyes.”

She looked after the little poor far-away figure and felt troubled in her usually comfortable mind.

“I wish she hadn’t gone so quick,” she said.

“I wish I could have given her twelve.” Then she turned to the child.

“Come in here,” said the woman, and she held open the shop door.

The child got up and walked in.

To be invited into a warm place full of bread seemed a wonderful thing.

She did not know what was going to happen.

She did not care, even.

“Get yourself warm,” said the woman, pointing to a fire in the tiny back room.

“And look here, when you are hard up for a bit of bread, you can come in here and ask for it.

I’ll give it to you in honor of that young one.”

Sara found some comfort in her remaining bun.

At all events, it was very hot, and it was better than nothing.

As she walked along, she broke off small pieces and ate them slowly to make them last longer.

When Sara returned to the house she met Miss Minchin, who had come downstairs to scold( 斥责 ) the cook.

“Where have you wasted your time?” she demanded.

“You have been out for hours.”

“It was so wet and muddy,” Sara answered, “it was hard to walk.”

“Make no excuses,” said Miss Minchin, “and tell no lies.”

Sara went into the kitchen.

“May I have something to eat?” Sara asked the cook rather weakly.

“Tea’s over and done with,” was the answer.

“Did you expect me to keep it hot for you?”

Sara stood silent for a second.

“I had no dinner,” she said.

“There’s some bread in the pantry( 食品储藏室 ),” said the cook.

“That’s all you’ll get at this time of day.”

Sara went and found the bread.

It was old and hard and dry.

It was difficult for the child to climb the three long flights of stairs leading to her attic.

She often found them long when she was tired, but tonight it seemed as if she would never reach the top.

When she reached the top landing of the attic stairs, she was glad to see the light coming from under her door.

That meant that Ermengarde had managed to come up to pay her a visit.

Yes, there Ermengarde was when she opened the door.

She was sitting in the middle of the bed, with her feet placed safely under her.

“You do look tired, Sara,” she said; “you are quite pale.”

“I am tired,” said Sara, dropping on to the uneven footstool.

“I did not expect to see you tonight, Ermie.”

“Miss Amelia has gone out to spend the night with her old aunt,” she explained.

“No one else ever comes and looks into the bedrooms after we are in bed. I could stay here until morning if I wanted to.”

It was just at this minute that something happened at the skylight which neither of them saw.

If either of them had by chance turned and looked up, she would have been surprised by the sight of a dark face.

It looked carefully into the room and disappeared as quickly and almost as silently as it had appeared.

Not quite as silently, however.

Sara, who had good hearing, suddenly turned a little and looked up at the roof.

“That didn’t sound like Melchisedec,” she said.

“What?” said Ermengarde, a little uncertain.

“Didn’t you think you heard something?” asked Sara.

“N-no,” Ermengarde said nervously. “Did you?”

“Perhaps I didn’t,” said Sara, “but I thought I did. It sounded as if something was on the roof—something that dragged softly.”

“What could it be?” said Ermengarde.

“Could it be—robbers( 盗贼 )?”

“No,” Sara began cheerfully.

“There is nothing to steal—”

She broke off in the middle of her words.

They both heard the sound that checked her.

It was not on the roof, but on the stairs below, and it was Miss Minchin’s angry voice.

Sara sprang off the bed, and put out the candle.

“She is scolding Becky,” she whispered, as she stood in the darkness. “She is making her cry.”

“Will she come in here?” Ermengarde whispered back, full of fear.

“No. She will think I am in bed. Don’t move.”

“You ungrateful, dishonest child!” they heard her say.

“Cook tells me she has missed things repeatedly.”

“It wasn’t me, ma’am,” said Becky crying.

“I was hungry enough, but it wasn’t me—never!”

“You deserve to be sent to prison,” said Miss Minchin’s voice.

“Picking and stealing! Half a meat pie, indeed!”

“It wasn’t me,” cried Becky.

“I could have eaten a whole one—but I never laid a finger on it.”
<hr>
Miss Minchin was out of breath between anger and climbing the stairs.

The meat pie had been saved for her special late supper.

It became clear that she boxed Becky’s ears.

“Don’t tell lies,” she said.

“Go to your room this instant.”

Both Sara and Ermengarde heard the sound of the hit, and then heard Becky run up the stairs and into her attic.

They heard her door shut, and knew that she threw herself upon her bed.

“I could have eaten two of them,” they heard her cry into her pillow.

“But I never took a bite. It was cook who gave it to her policeman.”

Sara stood in the middle of the room in the darkness.

She was pressing her little teeth together and opening and closing her hands angrily.

She could hardly stand still, but she did not move until Miss Minchin had gone down the stairs and all was still.

“The awful, cruel thing!” Sara cried out.

“The cook takes things herself and then says Becky steals them.

She doesn’t! She doesn’t!”

She pressed her hands hard against her face and burst into tears, and Ermengarde, hearing this unusual thing, was surprised by it.

Sara was crying!

The unbeatable Sara!

It seemed to show something new—some state she had never known.

Suppose—suppose—a new terrible possibility presented itself to Ermengarde’s kind, little mind all at once.

“Sara,” she said in a shy, almost frightened voice, “I don’t want to be rude, but—are you ever hungry?”

It was too much just at that moment.

The wall broke down.

Sara lifted her face from her hands.

“Yes,” she said in a new way, full of feeling.

“Yes, I am. And it makes it worse to hear poor Becky. She’s hungrier than I am.”

“Oh, oh!” Ermengarde cried sadly. “And I never knew!”

“I didn’t want you to know,” Sara said.

“It would have made me feel like a street beggar. I know I look like a street beggar.”

“No, you don’t—you don’t!” Ermengarde broke in.

“A little boy once gave me a sixpence for charity( 慈善 ),” said Sara.

“He wouldn’t have given me his Christmas sixpence if I hadn’t looked as if I needed it.”

“Who was he?” asked Ermengarde.

“He was a dear little thing going to a party,” said Sara.

“He was one of the Large Family, the little one with the round legs.

I suppose his nursery was full of Christmas presents and baskets full of cakes and things, and he could see I had nothing.”

Ermengarde gave a little jump back.

The last sentences had suddenly reminded her of something.

“Oh, Sara!” she cried.

“What a silly thing I am not to have thought of it!”

“Of what?”

“Something wonderful!” said Ermengarde, in an excited hurry.

“This very afternoon my nicest aunt sent me a box.

It is full of good things.

I never touched it, I had so much dessert at dinner.”

She began to speak very quickly.

“It’s got cake in it, and little meat pies, and jam tarts( 馅饼 ) and buns, and oranges, and figs( 无花果 ) and chocolate.

I’ll go back to my room and get it this minute, and we’ll eat it now.”

Sara almost fell over.

When one is weak with hunger, the mention of food has sometimes a strange effect.

She touched Ermengarde’s arm.

“Do you think—you could?” she asked.

“I know I could,” answered Ermengarde, and she ran to the door—opened it softly—put her head out into the darkness, and listened.

Then she went back to Sara.

“The lights are out.

Everybody’s in bed.

I can move quietly and slowly, and no one will hear.”

It was so delightful that they caught each other’s hands and a sudden light sprang into Sara’s eyes.

“Ermie!” she said.

“Let us pretend! Let us pretend it’s a party!

And oh, won’t you invite the prisoner in the next cell?”

“Yes! Yes! Let us knock on the wall now. The jailer won’t hear.”

Sara went to the wall.

Through it she could hear poor Becky crying more softly.

She knocked four times.

“That means, ‘Come to me through the secret passage under the wall,’ she explained.

‘I have something to communicate.’ ”

Five quick knocks answered her.

“She is coming,” she said.

Almost immediately the door of the attic opened and Becky appeared.

Her eyes were red and her cap was falling off.

When she caught sight of Ermengarde, she began to wipe her face nervously with her skirt.

“Don’t mind me a bit, Becky!” cried Ermengarde.

“Miss Ermengarde has asked you to come in,” said Sara, “because she is going to bring a box of good things up here to us.”

Becky’s cap almost fell off entirely, she broke in with such excitement.

“To eat, miss?” she said. “Things that’s good to eat?”

“Yes,” answered Sara, “and we are going to pretend a party.”

“And you shall have as much as you want to eat,” put in Ermengarde.

“I’ll go this minute!”

She was in such a hurry that as she carefully left the attic, she dropped her red shawl( 披肩 ) and did not know it had fallen.

No one saw it for a minute or so.

Becky could not believe the good luck which had come into her life.

“Somehow, something always happens,” Sara cried, “just before things get to the very worst. It is as if the Magic did it.

If I could only just remember that always.

The worst thing never quite comes.”

She gave Becky a little cheerful shake.

“We must hurry and set the table.”

“Set the table, miss?” said Becky, looking round the room.

“What’ll we set it with?”

Sara looked round the attic, too.

“There doesn’t seem to be much,” she answered, half laughing.

That moment she saw something and picked it up.

It was Ermengarde’s red shawl which lay upon the floor.

“Here’s the shawl,” she cried.

“I know she won’t mind it. It will make such a nice red tablecloth.”

They pulled the old table forward, and threw the shawl over it.

“What next, now?” said Sara, and she stood still and put her hands over her eyes.

“I must look among the things in the old trunk I had when I was a princess.”

She flew to its corner and knelt down.

It had not been put in the attic for her benefit, but because there was no room for it elsewhere.

Nothing had been left in it but rubbish.

But she knew she should find something.

The Magic always arranged that kind of thing in one way or another.

She found twelve small white handkerchiefs.

She seized them joyfully and ran to the table.

She began to arrange them upon the red table cover.

“These are the plates,” she said.

“They are golden plates.

These are the richly decorated( 装饰的 ) napkins( 餐巾纸 ).

Nuns( 修女 ) worked on them in Spain.”

“Did they, miss?” breathed Becky, delighted by the information.

“You must pretend it,” said Sara.

“If you pretend it enough, you will see them.”

She held an old summer hat in her hand which she had fished out of the bottom of the trunk.

There were flowers on it. She pulled them off.

“These are flowers for the meal,” she said.

“They fill all the air with perfume.

There’s a mug( 杯子 ) on the washstand( 脸盆架 ), Becky.

Oh—and bring the soap dish for the center of the table.”

Becky handed them to her seriously.

“What are they now, miss?” she asked.

“This is a carved( 精雕细琢的 ) cup,” said Sara, arranging the flowers about the mug.

“And this”—bending carefully over the soap dish and covering it with roses—“is purest white stone coated with jewels.”

She touched the things gently, a happy smile on her lips which made her look as if she were in a dream.

“My, isn’t it lovely!” whispered Becky.

Then the door opened, and Ermengarde came in, rather struggling under the weight of her basket.

She started back with a cry of joy.

The difference between the cold darkness outside and the totally unexpected festive table in the room, was most wonderful indeed.

“Oh, Sara!” she cried out.

“You are the cleverest girl I ever saw!”

“Isn’t it nice?” said Sara.

As the things were taken out of the basket—the cakes—the fruits—the sweets( 糖果 ) and the wine—the meal became a splendid thing.

“It’s like a real party!” cried Ermengarde.

“It’s like a queen’s table,” sighed Becky.

They had hardly had time to take their pieces of cake into their hands when they all three sprang to their feet and turned pale faces toward the door—listening—listening.

Someone was coming up the stairs.

There was no mistake about it.

Each of them knew the sound of the angry steps, and knew that the end of all things had come.

“It’s—the missus!” cried Becky, and dropped her piece of cake upon the floor.

“Yes,” said Sara, her eyes growing surprised and large in her small white face.

“Miss Minchin has found us out.”

Miss Minchin struck the door open with a blow of her hand.

She was pale herself, but it was with anger.

She looked from the frightened faces to the table full of food.

“I knew something of this sort was going on,” she said excitedly, “but I did not dream of such bad behavior. Lavinia was telling the truth.”

So they knew that it was Lavinia who had somehow guessed their secret and had told on them.

Miss Minchin walked over to Becky and boxed her ears for a second time.

“You disobedient( 不听话的 ) creature!” she said.

“You leave the house in the morning!”

Sara stood quite still, with her eyes growing larger, and her face turning whiter.

Ermengarde began to cry.

“Oh, don’t send her away,” she cried.

“My aunt sent me the basket. We’re—only—having a party.”

“So I see,” said Miss Minchin.

“With the Princess Sara at the head of the table.”

She turned fiercely on Sara.

“It is your doing, I know,” she cried.

“Ermengarde would never have thought of such a thing.

You decorated the table, I suppose—with this rubbish.”

She stamped her foot at Becky.

“Go to your attic!” she said, and Becky stole away, with her shoulders shaking.

Then it was Sara’s turn again.

“I will deal with you tomorrow.

You shall have neither breakfast, dinner, nor supper!”

“I have not had either dinner or supper today, Miss Minchin,” said Sara, rather weakly.

“Then all the better.

You will have something to remember.

Don’t stand there. Put those things into the basket again.”

Then she quickly put the rest of the food back into the basket, gave it back to Ermengarde and pushed her toward the door.

“Go to bed this instant,” she said.

And she shut the door behind herself and poor Ermengarde, and left Sara standing quite alone.

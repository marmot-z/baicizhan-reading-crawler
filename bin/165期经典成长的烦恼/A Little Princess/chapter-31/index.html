                        <div><p class="text-left">She rose to get the case and brought it back to the fire.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I can write to him,” she said joyfully, “and leave it on the table.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then perhaps the person who takes the things away will take it, too.</p>
<p class="text-left">He won’t mind my thanking him, I feel sure.”</p>
<p class="text-left">So she wrote a note. This is what she said:</p>
<p class="text-left">I hope you will not think it is improper that I should write this note to you when you wish to keep yourself a secret.</p>
<p class="text-left">I only want to thank you for being so kind to me and making everything like a fairy story.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am so thankful to you, and I am so happy—and so is Becky.</p>
<p class="text-left">We used to be so lonely and cold and hungry.</p>
<p class="text-left">Please let me say just these words.</p>
<p class="text-left">Thank you—thank you—thank you!</p>
<p class="text-left">The Little Girl in the Attic.</p>
<p class="text-left">The next morning she left this on the little table.</p>
<p class="text-left">In the evening it had been taken away with the other things.</p>
<p class="text-left">So she knew the Magician had received it, and she was happier for the thought.</p>
<p class="text-left">She was reading one of her new books to Becky just before they went to sleep, when she heard a sound at the skylight.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Something’s there, miss,” Becky whispered.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” said Sara, slowly.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It sounds—rather like a cat—trying to get in.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She left her chair and went to the skylight.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was a strange little sound she heard—like a soft scratching( 刮擦 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">She suddenly remembered a little visitor who had made his way into the attic once before.</p>
<p class="text-left">She had seen him that very afternoon, sitting on a table before a window in the Indian gentleman’s house.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Suppose,” she whispered, “just suppose it was the monkey who got away again. Oh, I wish it was!”</p>
<p class="text-left">She climbed on a chair, very carefully raised the skylight, and looked out.</p>
<p class="text-left">It had been snowing all day.</p>
<p class="text-left">On the snow, quite near her, sat a tiny, shaking figure, with a small black face.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It is the monkey,” she cried out.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He has escaped from the Lascar’s attic, and he saw the light.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Becky ran to her side.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Are you going to let him in, miss?” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes,” Sara answered joyfully.</p>
<p class="text-left">“It’s too cold for monkeys to be out. I’ll try to draw him in.”</p>
<p class="text-left">She put a hand out carefully, speaking in an inviting voice.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come along, monkey dear,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I won’t hurt you.”</p>
<p class="text-left">He let her lift him through the skylight.</p>
<p class="text-left">When he found himself in her arms, he curled up to her breast and looked up into her face.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What shall you do with him?” Becky asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“I shall let him sleep with me tonight, and then take him back to the Indian gentleman tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="text-left">And when she went to bed she made him a little bed at her feet.</p>
<p class="text-left">He lay down and slept there as if he were a baby and much pleased with his quarters( 住处 ).</p>
<p class="text-left">The next afternoon Mr. Carmichael went to visit Mr. Carrisford in his library.</p>
<p class="text-left">“What news?” Mr. Carrisford asked.</p>
<p class="text-left">“The child the Russian people adopted?”</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is not the child we are looking for,” was Mr. Carmichael’s answer.</p>
<p class="text-left">“She is much younger than Captain Crewe’s little girl.</p>
<p class="text-left">Her name is Emily Carew.</p>
<p class="text-left">The Russians were able to give me all the information.”</p>
<p class="text-left">How tired and miserable( 痛苦的 ) the Indian gentleman looked!</p>
<p class="text-left">“Then the search has to be begun over again,” he said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Come, come,” Carmichael said in his cheery voice; “we’ll find her sooner or later.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“We must begin at once. No time must be lost,” Mr. Carrisford worried.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Do you have any new suggestion to make—any at all?”</p>
<p class="text-left">Mr. Carmichael felt rather restless, and he began to walk around the room with a thoughtful face.</p>
<p class="text-left">“We have searched the schools in Paris.</p>
<p class="text-left">Let us give up Paris and begin in London.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“There are schools enough in London,” said Mr. Carrisford.</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he slightly started, awakened by a recollection.</p>
<p class="text-left">“By the way, there is one next door.”</p>
<p class="text-left">“Then we will begin there.</p>
<p class="text-left">We cannot begin nearer than next door.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Perhaps the Magic was at work again at that very moment.</p>
<p class="text-left">What was it that brought Ram Dass into the room—even as his master spoke—with a touch of excitement in his dark, shining eyes?</p>
<p class="text-left">“Sahib( 阁下 ),” Ram Dass said, “the child herself has come—the child the sahib felt pity for.</p>
<p class="text-left">She brings back the monkey who had again run away to her attic.</p>
<p class="text-left">I have asked her to remain.</p>
<p class="text-left">It was my thought that it would please the sahib to speak with her.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The Indian gentleman waved his hand to Ram Dass, and addressed him.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Yes, I should like to see her.</p>
<p class="text-left">Go and bring her in.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then he turned to Mr. Carmichael.</p>
<p class="text-left">“While you have been away,” he explained, “I have been lonely.</p>
<p class="text-left">The days were so dark and long.</p>
<p class="text-left">Ram Dass told me of this child’s troubles, and together we invented a plan to help her.</p>
<p class="text-left">I suppose it was a childish thing to do, but it gave me something to plan and think of.”</p>
<p class="text-left">Then Sara came into the room, with the monkey in her arms.</p>
<p class="text-left">“Your monkey ran away again,” she said.</p>
<p class="text-left">“He came to my window last night, and I took him in because it was so cold.</p>
<p class="text-left">I would have brought him back if it had not been so late.</p>
<p class="text-left">I knew you were ill and might not like to be troubled.”</p>
<p class="text-left">The Indian gentleman’s sad eyes looked at her with curious interest.</p>
<p class="text-left">“That was very thoughtful of you,” he said.</p></div>
